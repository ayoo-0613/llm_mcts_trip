      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt and output a FailureGradient. The instructions are pretty detailed, so I'll go through them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that there are five candidates with IDs 0 to 4. Each has a bundle of cities, various summaries like city_summary, edge_summary, lb_costs, and feasibility info. My task is to pick the best one based on these factors.\n\nLooking at the hard_rules, the candidate_id must be an integer between 0 and 4, so I can only choose from those options. Also, I shouldn't invent any cities; just select from the given IDs.\n\nThe failure_report indicates some issues: missing_flight, outbound, and return. The current_bundle is [\"Del Rio\", \"Abilene\", \"Amarillo\"], but wait, looking at the candidates, none of them have Del Rio in their bundle. So maybe that's a dead end city I should avoid if possible.\n\nThe gating_summary says mode is hard_gate with notes about gated_pool_size=5. Excluded_n is 0, and there are 5 candidates. No exclusions here.\n\nNow, looking at each candidate:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Bundle [\"Abilene\", \"Wichita Falls\", \"Amarillo\"]. City summaries show Wichita Falls has a hotel_min_price of $823, which is higher than others. Edge from Wichita Falls to Amarillo isn't blocked.\n  \n- **Candidate 1**: Bundle includes Houston. Hotel price in Houston is $604, which is better than Wichita Falls but still higher than Amarillo's $510.\n\n- **Candidate 2**: Includes Lubbock with a hotel_min_price of $1029, which is quite high and has no slack. This might be risky because if there are issues, the cost could escalate quickly.\n\n- **Candidate 3**: Bundle [\"Abilene\", \"Amarillo\", \"Lubbock\"]. Amarillo's hotel price is okay, but Lubbock again has a high price with no slack.\n\n- **Candidate 4**: Includes Corpus Christi with a hotel_min_price of $619. This is better than Wichita Falls and Houston but still higher than Amarillo.\n\nThe failure_report mentions \"missing_flight\", which might mean there are issues with flight availability, so I should prefer candidates with edges that aren't blocked. Looking at all edge summaries, none are blocked except maybe in Candidate 2 where the edge from Lubbock to Amarillo is not blocked. Wait, no— all edges for each candidate have \"blocked\": false.\n\nWait, but looking back, in each candidate's edge_summary, all edges are unblocked (blocked: false). So that rule about preferring candidates with no blocked edges isn't helping me here since none have blocked edges.\n\nNext, the instruction to prefer avoiding dead_end_city. The failure_report has dead_end_city as null, so maybe that's not a concern right now.\n\nLooking at bundle_risk and lb_costs:\n\n- **Transport LB Cost**: Candidate 0 has 4649, which is lower than others except for some (like Candidate 3 with 4738). Lower transport cost is better.\n  \n- **Stay LB Cost**: Candidate 2 and 3 have higher stay costs due to high hotel prices.\n\n- **Meal LB Cost**: Candidate 0 has 1155, which seems reasonable. Others are similar except maybe Candidate 4 with 1125.\n\nConsidering bundle_lb_cost: Candidate 0 is at 9650, which is lower than others like Candidate 4's 10265.\n\nSo, based on the lb_costs, especially transport and stay costs, Candidates 0 and 3 are better. But looking at city summaries:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Wichita Falls has a high hotel_min_price of $823 with only $1 slack. That might be a problem if there's any unexpected cost.\n\n- **Candidate 3**: Lubbock is also expensive, but Amarillo and Abilene seem more manageable.\n\nWait, looking at feasibility for each candidate:\n\nAll have return_leg_exists: true and hotel_feasible_all: true, so no immediate red flags.\n\nThe soft_penalties in the gradient should consider features like budget_risk, cost_ratio, etc. Since Candidate 0 has a higher hotel_min_price but with some slack (hotel_slack:1), it's better than others without slack.\n\nWait, actually, looking at city_summary:\n\n- **Candidate 2**: Lubbock has hotel_slack:0 and meal_slack:15. So if something goes wrong, there's no flexibility here.\n  \n- **Candidate 3**: Amarillo has hotel_slack:0 but meal_slack:24. Maybe better than Candidate 2.\n\nBut the main issue is high hotel prices in Candidates 2 and 3. So perhaps going back to Candidates 0,1, or 4.\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize lower budget_risk. Looking at bundle_risk:\n\n- **Bottleneck_hotel_price**: The highest for each candidate seems like a key factor. Candidate 0 has $823 (Wichita Falls), Candidate 1 has $604 (Houston), Candidate 4 has $619 (Corpus Christi). So Candidates 1 and 4 are better than 0 in terms of hotel prices.\n\nBut considering meal_slack, maybe:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Amarillo has meal_slack:21. That's good.\n  \n- **Candidate 1**: Houston has meal_slack:25, which is even better.\n\nWait, higher slack is better because it means more flexibility if costs increase.\n\nSo looking at both hotel price and meal_slack:\n\n- Candidate 0: High hotel but high meal slack.\n- Candidate 1: Lower hotel than 0, but slightly lower meal slack (25 vs. 21).\n- Candidate 4: Similar to 1 but with higher meal slack (23).\n\nBut also considering the bundle_risk.bottleneck_city for each candidate.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to make a table:\n\n| Candidate | Cities                  | Hotel Prices (bottleneck) | Meal Slack (bottleneck) | Transport LB Cost | Stay LB Cost |\n|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| 0         | Abilene, Wichita Falls, Amarillo | $823 (Wichita)             | 21 (Amarillo)           | 4649              | 1528         |\n| 1         | Abilene, Houston, Amarillo     | $604 (Houston)            | 25 (Houston?)           | 5733              | 1808         |\n| 2         | Abilene, Lubbock, Amarillo    | $1029 (Lubbock)           | 12 (Lubbock)            | 4738              | 2546         |\n| 3         | Abilene, Amarillo, Lubbock     | $1029 (Lubbock)           | 24 (Amarillo?)          | 4738              | 2546         |\n| 4         | Abilene, Corpus Christi, Amarillo | $619 (Corpus Christi)| 23 (Corpus Christi)    | 5702              | 1838         |\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the bottleneck cities. For each candidate, the bundle_risk.bottleneck_city is different:\n\n- Candidate 0: Bottleneck_hotel_price is Wichita Falls ($823)\n- Candidate 1: Bottleneck is Houston ($604)\n- Candidate 2: Bottleneck is Lubbock ($1029)\n- Candidate 3: Bottleneck is Lubbock ($1029)\n- Candidate 4: Bottleneck is Corpus Christi ($619)\n\nSo, the lower the bottleneck_hotel_price and higher the meal_slack in that city would be better.\n\nComparing Candidates 1 and 4:\n\n- **Candidate 1**: Houston has a hotel price of $604 with meal slack 25.\n- **Candidate 4**: Corpus Christi is $619 but meal slack 23. So slightly worse on both counts.\n\nSo between them, Candidate 1 seems better.\n\nBut wait, looking at the failure_report: missing_flight, outbound, return. Maybe I should check if any candidate has issues with these phases. But all have return_leg_exists: true, so that's covered.\n\nThe soft_penalties in the output_schema suggest features like cost_ratio, budget_risk, etc. So perhaps higher meal slack is better for flexibility, even if hotel prices are a bit higher.\n\nSo between Candidates 0 and 1:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Higher hotel price but higher meal slack (21). Also, transport LB cost is lower.\n- **Candidate 1**: Lower hotel price but slightly lower meal slack (25 vs. 21? Wait no: Candidate 1 has Houston's meal_slack at 23? Or is it Amarillo's?)\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nEach candidate's city_summary includes all cities in their bundle. So for Candidate 0, the cities are Abilene, Wichita Falls, Amarillo.\n\nSo the bottleneck_city is Wichita Falls with hotel price $823 and meal slack 21 (from Amarillo? Or Wichita Falls? I think it's per city.)\n\nWait, no: each candidate has their own bundle_risk which includes the bottleneck_city. So for Candidate 0, the bottleneck_hotel_price is Wichita Falls ($823), and the meal_slack in that same city might be different.\n\nLooking at Candidate 0:\n\ncity_summary for Wichita Falls: hotel_min_price $823, hotel_slack 1 (because only 1?), but I'm not sure if slack refers to that city or overall. Wait, no— each city has its own stats.\n\nSo, in Candidate 0's bundle_risk.bottleneck_city is Wichita Falls, which has:\n\n- hotel_min_price $823\n- meal_slack for Wichita Falls would be... looking at the data, actually, the city_summary lists all cities. So for Candidate 0, Amarillo has meal_slack:21.\n\nBut the bottleneck might refer to the most critical point. So if the flight is missing or issues arise, the high hotel cost in Wichita Falls could cause problems, but since there's some slack (hotel_slack:1), it's manageable.\n\nIn contrast, Candidate 1's bottleneck is Houston with $604 and meal_slack of 23 (assuming that's for Houston). So better than Wichita Falls.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nEach candidate has their own city_summary. For example, in Candidate 0's city_summary, Amarillo has meal_slack:21. But the bottleneck_city is Wichita Falls with hotel_min_price $823 and maybe a lower meal_slack?\n\nLooking back at the data:\n\nCandidate 0's city_summary includes:\n\n- Abilene: hotel_min_price $590, slack 1; meal_min $11, slack 24\n- Wichita Falls: $823, slack 1; meal_min $10.5, slack 21\n- Amarillo: $510, slack 1; meal_min $11, slack 21\n\nWait, no— the city_summary for each candidate lists all cities in their bundle. So for Candidate 0:\n\nAbilene: hotel_min_price $590, slack 1; meal_slack:24\nWichita Falls: $823, slack 1; meal_slack:21\nAmarillo: $510, slack 1; meal_slack:21\n\nSo the bottleneck_city is Wichita Falls with hotel_min_price $823 and meal_slack 21.\n\nCandidate 1's city_summary:\n\nAbilene: same as above\nHouston: $604, slack 0; meal_slack:25\nAmarillo: same as above\n\nSo for Candidate 1, the bottleneck_city is Houston with hotel_min_price $604 and meal_slack 25. That's better in terms of meal_slack but higher hotel price than Amarillo.\n\nBut considering that slack in hotel is 0 for Houston (no flexibility), whereas Wichita Falls has a slight slack.\n\nSo comparing:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Higher hotel cost ($823) but with some slack, and higher meal slack (21).\n- **Candidate 1**: Lower hotel cost ($604) but no slack in hotel, and slightly lower meal slack (25 vs. 21).\n\nIt's a trade-off between lower immediate costs versus more flexibility.\n\nGiven the failure_report mentions missing_flight, maybe I should prioritize having some slack in case of issues. So Candidate 0 might be better because even though the hotel cost is higher, there's some slack and higher meal slack.\n\nBut wait, looking at the transport LB cost:\n\nCandidate 0 has 4649, which is lower than Candidate 1's 5733. Lower transport cost is good.\n\nSo combining all factors: lower transport cost, acceptable hotel price with some slack, and decent meal slack. So I think Candidate 0 is better.\n\nBut let me check Candidate 4 as well:\n\nCandidate 4's bundle_risk.bottleneck_city is Corpus Christi with $619 and meal_slack 23. That's slightly higher than Houston but still manageable. The transport LB cost for Candidate 4 is 5702, which is higher than both 0 and 1.\n\nSo between Candidates 0 and 1:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Lower transport cost, higher hotel price with some slack.\n- **Candidate 1**: Slightly higher transport cost but lower hotel price, no slack in hotel, slightly better meal slack.\n\nI think I'll go with Candidate 0 because the lower transport cost is a significant factor and the higher slack provides more flexibility against potential issues like missing flights or other uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, the best candidate is ID 0.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Candidates**: Five candidates (IDs 0-4) with varying city bundles and costs.\n\n2. **Evaluate Costs**:\n   - Transport LB Cost: Lower is better.\n     - Candidate 0: $4,649\n     - Others: Higher than this.\n   - Hotel Prices (Bottleneck City):\n     - Candidates 1 ($604) and 4 ($619) are lower than 0 ($823).\n   - Meal Slack:\n     - Higher slack provides more flexibility.\n     - Candidate 0 has higher meal slack in Amarillo (21).\n\n3. **Consider Flexibility**:\n   - Slack in hotel prices: Candidates with higher slack have better flexibility.\n   - Candidate 0's Wichita Falls has some slack, while Candidates 1 and 4 have less or no slack.\n\n4. **Weigh Factors**:\n   - Lower transport cost is crucial.\n   - Higher meal slack enhances adaptability against issues like missing flights.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Candidate 0 offers the lowest transport cost with acceptable hotel prices and higher meal slack, providing better overall flexibility.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe best candidate to select is ID \\boxed{0}.",

      "raw": "<think>\nAlright, I need to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt based on the given data. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the hard rules provided. The candidate_id must be an integer between 0 and 4, inclusive. Also, I shouldn't invent any cities; only choose from the existing ones. Importantly, I should output JSON with specific keys: candidate_id, reason, confidence, and gradient.\n\nThe failure_report indicates that the failed_phase is unknown, but it mentions dead_end_city as null and some violations like \"missing_flight\", \"outbound\", and \"return\". This suggests issues with flight availability in the current path. The current_bottleneck shows high hotel prices in Wichita Falls, which might be a problem.\n\nLooking at the gating_summary, the mode is set to hard_gate, which means exclusions are based on hard gates rather than soft penalties. There's an excluded_n of 1 and candidates_n of 5, so one candidate was excluded because it's the same as the current bundle, which is [\"Abilene\", \"Wichita Falls\", \"Amarillo\"]. So, the current bundle has issues, possibly related to hotel prices in Wichita Falls.\n\nNow, examining each candidate:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Bundle includes Houston. The bottleneck edge is still Santa Barbara->Abilene, but this candidate's lb_costs are higher than others. Hotel prices in Houston are lower than Wichita Falls (604 vs 823), which could be a good alternative.\n\n- **Candidate 1**: Includes Lubbock. The hotel price here is 1029, which is even higher than Wichita Falls. This might not be ideal as it could exacerbate the budget issues.\n\n- **Candidate 2**: Same issue with Lubbock's high hotel prices and a lower meal slack compared to others. Not preferable unless other factors are better.\n\n- **Candidate 3**: Corpus Christi has a lower hotel price (619) than Wichita Falls, which might alleviate some budget pressure. However, the edge costs are higher than other candidates.\n\n- **Candidate 4**: Adds Del Rio with a hotel price of 568, which is much better. This could help reduce the overall budget risk. The edge_summary shows no blocked edges, which is a plus because flight issues were in the failure_report.\n\nConsidering the hard rules to avoid dead_end_city (Wichita Falls) if feasible and preferring candidates without blocked edges, Candidate 4 stands out. It avoids Wichita Falls, has lower hotel prices, and all its edges are unblocked. The bundle includes Abilene, Del Rio, which seems more budget-friendly and avoids the problematic Wichita Falls.\n\nThe confidence is high because avoiding higher-priced cities and dead-ends makes this a safer bet for the next attempt.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 4,\n  \"reason\": \"Avoids dead_end_city (Wichita Falls) with lower hotel price in Del Rio, no blocked edges.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"hotel\", \"feature\": \"budget_risk\", \"delta\": -0.1}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, I need to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt. Let's look at the candidates provided and evaluate them based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, all candidates have their feasibility as true, so none are immediately excluded. The main considerations are the hard rules from the task description:\n\n1. Avoid dead_end_city if possible.\n2. Prefer candidates with no blocked edges for flight failures.\n\nLooking at each candidate's bundle_risk and edge_summary:\n\n- Candidate 0: Edge from Santa Barbara->Abilene is not blocked, so good on that front. The cities include Amarillo, which isn't a dead end as per the current info.\n  \n- Candidate 1: Similar to 0; all edges are unblocked.\n\n- Candidate 2: All edges are unblocked here too.\n\n- Candidate 3: Again, no blocked edges and includes Amarillo.\n\n- Candidate 4: No blocked edges either.\n\nNow, checking for dead_end_city. The current_bottleneck in the failure_report mentions \"Del Rio\" as a possible dead end, but none of the candidates include Del Rio except candidate 2 which has Lubbock. Wait, no—candidate 0 has Amarillo, which is different from Del Rio.\n\nWait, the current bundle is [\"Abilene\", \"Wichita Falls\", \"Del Rio\"], and the failure_report says dead_end_city is null. So perhaps we need to avoid including Del Rio as a city in the next attempt if possible, but none of the candidates include Del Rio except maybe candidate 2's bundle is [\"Abilene\", \"Lubbock\", \"Amarillo\"], so no.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the candidates:\n\n- Candidate 0: [\"Abilene\", \"Wichita Falls\", \"Amarillo\"]\n- Candidate 1: [\"Abilene\", \"Houston\", \"Amarillo\"]\n- Candidate 2: [\"Abilene\", \"Lubbock\", \"Amarillo\"]\n- Candidate 3: [\"Abilene\", \"Amarillo\", \"Lubbock\"]\n- Candidate 4: [\"Abilene\", \"Corpus Christi\", \"Amarillo\"]\n\nNone of them include Del Rio, which is the current dead_end_city. So they're all good in that aspect.\n\nNow, looking at other factors:\n\n- bundle_risk has hotel_price as a hard exclusion; check if any candidate has higher hotel prices leading to issues. Candidate 0's hotel_min_price for Wichita Falls is 823, which is high. But it's feasible according to their feasibility flag.\n\n- edge_summary: All edges are unblocked except none have blocked edges anyway.\n\nLooking at the lb_costs, lower costs might be better. Let's compare transport_lb_cost:\n\n- Candidate 0: 4649\n- Candidate 1: 5126\n- Candidate 2: 4501\n- Candidate 3: 4738\n- Candidate 4: 5702\n\nCandidate 2 has the lowest, so that's favorable.\n\nAlso, looking at hotel_min_price:\n\n- Candidate 0: Wichita Falls is high (823), but it's part of the bundle. The edge from Wichita Falls->Amarillo is unblocked.\n\nWait, perhaps we should prioritize lower hotel prices to avoid budget issues. Candidates 2 and 4 have Amarillo with a lower price.\n\nBut since all are feasible, I think the best candidate is the one with the lowest transport_lb_cost and minimal risk of dead ends or blocked edges.\n\nCandidate 0: While it has higher transport cost than 2, it includes Wichita Falls which isn't a dead end anymore. However, looking at their city_summary, Amarillo in candidate 0 has hotel_min_price 510 and slack 0, meaning no room for error, but since the feasibility is true, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps candidate 3 is better because it avoids Wichita Falls, which had high hotel prices. Or maybe candidate 2, as it has lower transport cost.\n\nWait, looking back at failure_report: current_bottleneck_city_meal is Del Rio, and city_hotel is Wichita Falls. So avoiding Wichita Falls might be better to prevent similar issues.\n\nSo candidates without Wichita Falls are 1, 2, 3, 4. Among these, candidate 0 includes Wichita Falls but it's still a candidate because the dead_end_city is null now.\n\nBut since all have unblocked edges and no immediate dead ends, perhaps we should look at other factors like meal costs or attr_slack.\n\nLooking at bundle_risk:\n\n- Candidate 0: bottleneck_meal_slack 21, attr_slack 17\n- Candidate 1: same as 0\n- Candidate 2: meal_slack 15, which is lower—so more risk if meals aren't found?\nWait, higher slack might mean less risk? Not sure.\n\nBut since all are feasible, perhaps choosing the one with the lowest lb_costs. So candidate 2 has transport_lb_cost 4501, which is the lowest among all except maybe others?\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n- Candidate 0: 4649\n- Candidate 1: 5126\n- Candidate 2: 4501 (lowest)\n- Candidate 3: 4738\n- Candidate 4: 5702\n\nSo candidate 2 has the lowest transport cost. Also, looking at their edge_summary, all edges are unblocked.\n\nAdditionally, the task mentioned to avoid dead_end_city; since none of the candidates include Del Rio or any other known dead end, they're all acceptable in that regard.\n\nTherefore, I think candidate 0 is not the best choice because it includes Wichita Falls with a high hotel price. But wait, candidate 0's bundle is [\"Abilene\", \"Wichita Falls\", \"Amarillo\"]. Since Wichita Falls had issues before, maybe we should avoid including it again to prevent recurrence.\n\nSo perhaps candidate 2 or 4 are better as they don't include Wichita Falls.\n\nBut among these, candidate 2 has lower transport costs and includes Lubbock which hasn't been a dead end. So I think candidate 0 is still okay because the failure_report's dead_end_city is null now.\n\nWait, but maybe the issue was with Del Rio, so including Wichita Falls again might not be a problem if it's feasible this time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps candidate 2 is better due to lower costs and avoiding Wichita Falls which had high hotel prices.\n\nSo after considering all factors, I think candidate 0 might still be acceptable, but candidate 2 seems more favorable with lower transport costs.\n\nWait, looking at the output_schema, gradient includes hard_exclusions. Since none of the candidates have blocked edges or dead_end_city now, perhaps there's no need for exclusions. The soft_penalties could consider features like hotel_price and meal_slack.\n\nBut since I need to choose a candidate_id, based on lowest transport costs and avoiding higher hotel prices in Wichita Falls, candidate 2 seems better. However, looking at the candidates again:\n\nCandidate 0 has Wichita Falls with high hotel price but it's feasible, while candidate 2 includes Lubbock which is new.\n\nBut maybe I should go for the one with the best overall metrics: lowest transport cost and minimal risk in other areas.\n\nSo, final decision: candidate 0 because its bundle includes cities that might be more familiar or have better infrastructure despite higher costs, but considering the lower transport cost of candidate 2, perhaps it's better to choose 2.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should just pick the one with the lowest transport_lb_cost, which is candidate 2.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Evaluate Candidates for Dead End Cities**: None of the candidates include \"Del Rio,\" the current dead end city, so no immediate exclusion based on this.\n\n2. **Check for Blocked Edges**: All candidates have unblocked edges, satisfying the requirement to avoid blocked edges for flight failures.\n\n3. **Compare Transport Costs (lb_costs)**: Candidate 2 has the lowest transport_lb_cost at 4501, making it a favorable choice.\n\n4. **Consider Hotel Prices**: Avoiding high hotel prices in Wichita Falls, candidate 2 doesn't include this city, thus reducing budget risk.\n\n**Final Selection:**\n\n- **Candidate ID**: 2\n- **Reason**: Lowest transport costs and avoids the previously problematic Wichita Falls.\n- **Confidence**: High (0.9) due to favorable metrics.\n- **Gradient**: No hard exclusions; soft penalties might include monitoring hotel prices in other cities.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 2,\n  \"reason\": \"Lowest transport costs and avoids problematic cities.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      { \"phase\": \"hotel_price\", \"feature\": \"hotel_min_price\", \"delta\": -5 }\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",
