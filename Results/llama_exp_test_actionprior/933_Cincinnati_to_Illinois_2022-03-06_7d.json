It contains several fields:\n\t+ `candidate_id`: A unique identifier for each candidate bundle (integer).\n\t+ `reason`: A short string explaining why a particular bundle was chosen or rejected.\n\t+ `confidence`: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's confidence in its predictions.\n\t+ `gradient`: An object containing three sub-objects:\n\t\t- `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples, each representing a hard exclusion rule. Each tuple contains four elements: phase (string), rule (string), TTL (integer), city? (boolean), and edge? (boolean).\n\t\t- `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples, each representing a soft penalty. Each tuple contains three elements: phase (string), feature (string), and delta (float).\n\t\t- `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples, each representing a retrieval patch. Each tuple contains three elements: phase (string), patch (string), and TTL (integer).\n\nThis output format appears to be designed for use in a machine learning or optimization context, where the model is generating candidate bundles based on certain constraints and preferences.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with something specific related to this data, please let me know what you're trying to accomplish!",
