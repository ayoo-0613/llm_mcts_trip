Our budget is set at $10,100. We specifically require accommodations that allow smoking and offer us privacy, as we are not interested in shared rooms. For dining, we're open to experiencing a variety of cuisines including Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Italian. We have no specific transportation requirements for the trip.",
