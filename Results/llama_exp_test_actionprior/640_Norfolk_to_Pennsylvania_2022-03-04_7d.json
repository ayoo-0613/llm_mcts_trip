Each candidate is represented by its id, reason, confidence level, and a gradient object containing exclusion rules, soft penalties, and retrieval patches. The gradient object seems to be related to the optimization process, possibly indicating the areas where improvements are needed or penalties are applied.\n\nWithout more context about the problem being solved, it's challenging to provide further insights into the meaning of this output. However, you can use this breakdown as a starting point for exploring the properties and contents of each candidate solution.",

      "raw": "This is a JSON object that represents the output of some kind of algorithm or model. It contains a list of candidate bundles, each with its own set of attributes and associated costs.\n\nHere are some key features of this output:\n\n* **Candidate Bundles**: The main structure of the output is a list of \"candidate_id\"s, which represent different possible bundles that can be created from a set of cities.\n* **Bundle Attributes**: Each candidate bundle has several attributes:\n\t+ `bundle`: A list of city names that make up the bundle.\n\t+ `lb_costs`: A dictionary with four keys: `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`, and `bundle_lb_cost`. These represent the total costs associated with each phase (transportation, stay, meal) and the overall cost of the bundle.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object with two boolean values: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`. These indicate whether a return leg is present in the bundle and whether all hotels are feasible for the bundle, respectively.\n* **Output Schema**: The final key-value pair at the end of the output represents the schema of the output. It specifies the format of each attribute in the output.\n\nHere's an example of how you might access some of these values:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON object into a Python dictionary\noutput = json.loads(output_string)\n\n# Get the list of candidate bundles\ncandidate_bundles = output['bundles']\n\n# Print out the first bundle's attributes\nbundle = candidate_bundles[0]\nprint(bundle['lb_costs']['transport_lb_cost'])  # Transportation cost\nprint(bundle['feasibility']['return_leg_exists'])  # Return leg exists flag\n\n# Access the schema of the output\nschema = output['output_schema']\nprint(schema['candidate_id'])\n```\nNote that this is just one possible way to access the values in the output. The exact syntax may vary depending on your specific use case and programming environment.",
