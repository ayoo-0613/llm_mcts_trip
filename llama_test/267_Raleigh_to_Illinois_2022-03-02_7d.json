Each object represents a candidate solution.\n\nHere's an example of what the first few lines of the output might look like:\n```\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 1,\n  \"reason\": \"Optimal route found\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"transport\", \"rule\": \"avoid highways\"},\n      {\"phase\": \"accommodation\", \"rule\": \"book hotel with pool\"}\n    ],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"food\", \"feature\": \"visit local restaurant\"},\n      {\"phase\": \"entertainment\", \"feature\": \"visit nearby attraction\"}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"transport\", \"patch\": \"use public transportation instead of driving\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  \"output\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 123,\n      \"route\": [\"Raleigh\", \"Durham\", \"Chapel Hill\"],\n      \"mode\": \"car\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote that the actual output will depend on the specific algorithm or program used to generate it.",

      "raw": "This is a JSON output from a machine learning model, specifically an ensemble model. The output contains a list of candidate bundles with their respective reasons, confidence levels, and gradients.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields:\n\n* `candidate_id`: A unique identifier for each bundle.\n* `reason`: A brief description of why this bundle was selected (e.g., \"best\" or \"acceptable\").\n* `confidence`: A value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the model is in its selection.\n* `gradient`: An object containing three fields:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of rules that prevented certain bundles from being considered.\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of penalties assigned to each bundle based on their features (e.g., cost, time).\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of patches applied to the retrieval phase to improve performance.\n\nThe `output_schema` field defines the structure of the output data. It specifies that:\n\n* `candidate_id` is an integer.\n* `reason` is a short string.\n* `confidence` is a float between 0 and 1.\n* The `gradient` object contains three lists:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of objects containing phase, rule, TTL, city, and edge information.\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of objects containing phase, feature, and delta information.\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of objects containing phase, patch, and TTL information.\n\nTo analyze this output, you would need to write code that can parse the JSON structure and extract relevant information. For example, you might want to calculate the average confidence level across all bundles or identify the most penalized feature in each bundle.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about this output or would you like help writing code to analyze it?",
