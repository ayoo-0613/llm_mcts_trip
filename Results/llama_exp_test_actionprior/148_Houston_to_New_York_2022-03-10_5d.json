For example, if you wanted to get all the candidate bundles with a feasibility metric of at least 0.5, you could write code like this:\n```python\nresponse = {...}  # load the JSON response into a Python object\n\ncandidate_bundles = [bundle for bundle in response['data'] if bundle['feasibility']['hotel_feasible_all']]\n```\nThis would give you a list of candidate bundles with their associated feasibility metrics.\n\nIf you have a specific question about extracting or analyzing this data, feel free to ask!",

Each object contains all four main fields (candidate_id, reason, confidence, and gradient) as described in the schema.\n\nSome key observations from the data:\n\n* The **confidence** values range from 0 to 1, indicating varying levels of confidence in each solution.\n* Some solutions have a high confidence value (> 0.8), while others have lower confidence (< 0.5).\n* Many solutions involve cities in New York State (e.g., Niagara Falls, Watertown, Plattsburgh) and have similar gradient values.\n\nTo further analyze this data, I'd recommend exploring the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the model's logic**: Study the machine learning algorithm used to generate these candidate solutions.\n2. **Exploring the dataset**: Investigate the input features and their relationships to the output solutions.\n3. **Analyzing the gradient values**: Delve deeper into the meaning of hard exclusions, soft penalties, and retrieval patches in the gradient object.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or areas you'd like to focus on!",
