It defines four types:\n\t+ `candidate_id`: A 32-bit integer\n\t+ `reason`: A short string (e.g., a brief description of why a bundle was selected or rejected)\n\t+ `confidence`: A float between 0 and 1, representing the confidence level in the recommendation\n\t+ `gradient`: An object with three sub-properties:\n\t\t- `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples containing four elements: phase (string), rule (string), TTL (integer), city (optional string), and edge (optional string)\n\t\t- `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing two elements: phase (string) and feature (string)\n\t\t- `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing three elements: phase (string), patch (string), and TTL (integer)\n\nThis output appears to be the result of a complex optimization algorithm that considers various factors, such as city and edge costs, meal and attraction preferences, and confidence levels. The algorithm likely uses machine learning or linear programming techniques to find an optimal bundle given these constraints.\n\nTo analyze this data further, you would need to:\n\n1. Understand the specific requirements and constraints of each phase (e.g., which cities are included in each phase).\n2. Examine the `bundle_risk` and `city_summary` attributes to identify any outliers or unusual patterns.\n3. Investigate the `edge_summary` attribute to see if there are any notable edge costs or restrictions.\n4. Analyze the `confidence` and `gradient` attributes to understand how the algorithm weights different factors in its recommendations.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a hypothetical analysis, as I don't have more context about the specific use case or requirements of the recommendation system.",

Aggregating the costs and risks across all candidate solutions.\n2. Identifying patterns or correlations between bundle characteristics and feasibility.\n3. Ranking candidate solutions based on their estimated costs and risks.\n\nWhat specific question or problem are you trying to solve with this output? I'll do my best to help you understand it better!",
