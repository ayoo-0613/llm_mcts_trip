Please ensure our accommodations allow children under 10 years old and are amenable to changes in the number of rooms required. We will not be using our own car, so transportation arrangements must be included. We have diverse tastes when it comes to food - we enjoy Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Indian cuisines.",
