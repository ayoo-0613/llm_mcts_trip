The format suggests it's related to travel planning or route optimization.\n\nHere's a high-level breakdown:\n\n1. **Bundle List**: This is the main part of the output, which contains a list of candidate bundles (i.e., groups of destinations). Each bundle has an `id` and various associated data.\n2. **Bundle Structure**: Each bundle consists of:\n\t* `bundle`: The ID of the bundle.\n\t* `bundle_risk`: An object containing risk metrics for this bundle, such as bottleneck meal slack, attribute slack, hotel price, etc.\n\t* `city_summary`: A collection of city-specific data, including minimum prices for hotels and meals.\n\t* `edge_summary`: A collection of edge-specific data, including costs between cities.\n3. **Output Schema**: This defines the structure of each field in the output. It's a dictionary that maps field names to their corresponding data types (e.g., integer, float, list).\n\nThe specific fields and data types are:\n\n* `candidate_id`: An integer ID for each bundle.\n* `reason`: A short string providing additional context or explanation for this bundle.\n* `confidence`: A floating-point value between 0 and 1 representing the confidence in this bundle's quality.\n* `gradient`: An object containing three lists:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples (phase, rule, TTL, city?, edge?) describing hard exclusions or constraints for this bundle.\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples (phase, feature, delta) representing soft penalties or costs associated with this bundle.\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples (phase, patch, TTL) describing retrieval patches or modifications to the model's output.\n\nWithout more context about the specific application or problem being addressed, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis or interpretation. However, I can help you understand the structure and relationships between these fields if you have any follow-up questions!",

      "raw": "This is a JSON object that represents the output of a machine learning model or a decision-making algorithm. The object contains a list of candidate bundles (trip combinations) with their respective attributes and scores.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the object:\n\n1. **`output_schema`**: This is an object that defines the schema of the output. It specifies the types and formats of the fields in the list.\n\t* **`candidate_id`**: An integer field representing the unique ID of each candidate bundle.\n\t* **`reason`**: A short string field explaining why a particular bundle was generated.\n\t* **`confidence`**: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level of the model in recommending a particular bundle.\n2. **`gradient`**: An object containing three lists that represent different types of scores or penalties associated with each candidate bundle:\n\t* **`hard_exclusions`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains information about a rule that excludes a particular phase or edge from consideration (e.g., `{phase: 'flight', rule: 'no flights available'}`).\n\t* **`soft_penalties`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a soft penalty applied to a feature (e.g., `{phase: 'transportation', feature: 'car rental cost', delta: 10.0}`).\n\t* **`retrieval_patches`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains information about a patch or correction to be applied during the retrieval process (e.g., `{phase: 'hotel', patch: 'override price', ttl: 30}`).\n\nThe actual output is a list of objects with these attributes. Each object represents a candidate bundle with its corresponding scores and penalties.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's an example of what one of the objects in the list might look like:\n```json\n{\n    \"candidate_id\": 1,\n    \"reason\": \"optimized for cost\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.8,\n    \"gradient\": {\n        \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n        \"soft_penalties\": [\n            {\"phase\": \"transportation\", \"feature\": \"car rental cost\", \"delta\": 10.0},\n            {\"phase\": \"hotel\", \"feature\": \"price\", \"delta\": 5.0}\n        ],\n        \"retrieval_patches\": []\n    }\n}\n```\nThis object represents a candidate bundle with ID 1, which has been optimized for cost ( confidence = 0.8). The bundle has two soft penalties: a car rental cost penalty of $10 and a hotel price penalty of $5. There are no hard exclusions or retrieval patches applied to this bundle.",
