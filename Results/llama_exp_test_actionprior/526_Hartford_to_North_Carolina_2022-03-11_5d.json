It has three main components:\n\n* `candidate_id`: An integer that identifies the candidate solution.\n* `reason`: A short string that provides context or explanation for the candidate.\n* `confidence`: A floating-point number between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence in the candidate.\n\n**Gradient**\n\nThe `gradient` object is a nested structure within the output schema. It defines three types of adjustments to be applied to the output:\n\n* `hard_exclusions`: A list of objects, each with properties:\n\t+ `phase`: A string representing the phase or stage of the algorithm.\n\t+ `rule`: A string representing the rule or constraint applied.\n\t+ `ttl`: An integer representing a time-to-live value.\n\t+ `city?` and `edge?`: Optional boolean flags indicating whether this exclusion applies to cities or edges, respectively.\n* `soft_penalties`: A list of objects, each with properties:\n\t+ `phase`: A string representing the phase or stage of the algorithm.\n\t+ `feature`: A string representing the feature or attribute being penalized.\n\t+ `delta`: A floating-point number representing the penalty amount.\n* `retrieval_patches`: A list of objects, each with properties:\n\t+ `phase`: A string representing the phase or stage of the algorithm.\n\t+ `patch`: A string representing the patch or correction applied.\n\t+ `ttl`: An integer representing a time-to-live value.\n\n**Candidate solutions**\n\nThe `data` array contains 11 objects, each representing a candidate solution. Each object has the same structure as defined in the output schema: `candidate_id`, `reason`, and `confidence`. Additionally, each object has an `gradient` property that is identical to the one defined in the output schema.\n\nOverall, this output schema definition appears to be part of a larger algorithm or model that generates candidate solutions based on some input data. The output schema defines the format and structure of these candidate solutions, including any adjustments or patches applied to them during processing.",
