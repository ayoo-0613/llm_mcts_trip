Each tuple has five elements: phase, rule, TTL, city?, and edge?.\n\t\t- `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing information about soft penalties applied to each phase. Each tuple has three elements: phase, feature, and delta.\n\t\t- `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing information about retrieval patches applied to each phase. Each tuple has three elements: phase, patch, and TTL.\n\nThe main data is represented as an array called `output`. Each element in this array corresponds to a candidate solution, and it contains the following fields:\n\n* `candidate_id`\n* `reason`\n* `confidence`\n* `gradient` (with its three sub-lists)\n\nTo get meaningful insights from this output, you would need to understand the specific optimization algorithm used and its parameters.

It describes the types and formats of each field, as well as any constraints or relationships between fields.\n\nSome potential applications of this data include:\n\n1. **Bundle recommendation**: Use the bundled information to generate recommendations for travelers based on their preferences and constraints.\n2. **Cost estimation**: Use the cost estimates in `lb_costs` to estimate the total cost of a trip given a set of bundles.\n3. **Feasibility analysis**: Analyze the feasibility data to identify potential issues with hotel availability or transportation costs.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex dataset, and any further analysis or interpretation would depend on the specific requirements and goals of your project.",

The output schema suggests that the algorithm assigns a confidence score to each candidate itinerary, which can be used for further analysis or ranking purposes.\n\nTo extract meaningful insights from this data, you could:\n\n1. Filter the list to only include itineraries with high confidence scores (> 0.8).\n2. Group the data by city pairs and calculate average costs (e.g., `bundle_lb_cost`) for each group.\n3. Visualize the data using a heatmap or scatter plot to identify patterns in cost distributions across different city pairs.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to help with any specific analysis or visualization tasks!",
