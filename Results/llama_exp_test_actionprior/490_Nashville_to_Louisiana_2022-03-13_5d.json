Each object has several keys:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the bundle (an integer).\n* `bundle_risk`: an object representing the risk associated with this bundle.\n\t+ `bottleneck_meal_slack`: an integer representing the slack in meal planning.\n\t+ `bottleneck_attr_slack`: an integer representing the slack in attractions planning.\n\t+ `bottleneck_hotel_price`: a float representing the hotel price for each city in the bundle.\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_meal`: a string representing the city with the most meals planned.\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_hotel`: a string representing the city with the highest hotel price.\n\t+ `bottleneck_edge`: a string representing the edge (city pair) with the highest cost.\n* `city_summary`: an object describing each city in the bundle. Each city has several keys:\n\t+ `days`: an integer representing the number of days spent in this city.\n\t+ `nights`: an integer representing the number of nights spent in this city.\n\t+ `hotel_min_price`: a float representing the minimum hotel price for this city.\n\t+ `meal_slack`: an integer representing the slack in meal planning for this city.\n\t+ `min_meal_cost`: a float representing the minimum cost of meals for this city.\n\t+ `attr_slack`: an integer representing the slack in attractions planning for this city.\n* `edge_summary`: an object describing each edge (city pair) in the bundle. Each edge has several keys:\n\t+ `min_cost`: a float representing the minimum cost of traveling between these cities.\n\n**Output Schema**\n\nThe `output_schema` object describes the schema of the output, including:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer representing the candidate ID.\n* `reason`: a short string describing why this bundle was selected.\n* `confidence`: a float between 0 and 1 representing the confidence in this bundle.\n* `gradient`: an object with three keys:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of objects, each describing a hard exclusion (a rule that must be followed).\n\t\t- `phase`: a string representing the phase (e.g. \"travel\", \"accommodation\").\n\t\t- `rule`: a string representing the rule.\n\t\t- `ttl`: an integer representing the time to live for this rule.\n\t\t- `city?`: an optional string representing the city affected by this rule.\n\t\t- `edge?`: an optional string representing the edge (city pair) affected by this rule.\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of objects, each describing a soft penalty.\n\t\t- `phase`: a string representing the phase (e.g. \"travel\", \"accommodation\").\n\t\t- `feature`: a string representing the feature being penalized.\n\t\t- `delta`: a float representing the amount of the penalty.\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of objects, each describing a retrieval patch.\n\t\t- `phase`: a string representing the phase (e.g. \"travel\", \"accommodation\").\n\t\t- `patch`: a string representing the patch applied to this phase.\n\t\t- `ttl`: an integer representing the time to live for this patch.\n\nThis output schema suggests that the algorithm is providing a candidate bundle with a confidence score, along with explanations for why this bundle was selected and the rules or penalties that were considered.",
