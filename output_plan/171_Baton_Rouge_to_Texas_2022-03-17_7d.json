The travel dates are set from March 17th to March 23rd, 2022. Our travel budget has been adjusted to $14,600. Bearing in mind that we have children under ten years old, our accommodations need to allow young children and we prefer to occupy entire rooms. We also prefer not to self-drive during this trip.",
