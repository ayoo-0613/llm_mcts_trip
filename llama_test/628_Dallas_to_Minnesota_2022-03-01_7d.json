In this case, it's because of a combination of factors that make this bundle the best choice.\n*   `confidence`: A floating point number between 0 and 1 indicating how confident we are in this candidate solution. The higher the value, the more confident we are.\n\nThe gradient is also included to provide additional information about the decision-making process:\n\n*   `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples containing phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge, which represents hard exclusions from the search space.\n*   `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing phase, feature, delta, which represents soft penalties or additional information that might have influenced the decision.\n\nThe candidate with ID 6 is selected because it combines a low bundle risk score (`bundle_risk`) and favorable city summary scores for Minneapolis and International Falls. Additionally, the edge summaries show good transportation costs to/from Dallas, and the least bound cost (`lb_costs`) among all candidates makes this solution stand out as more desirable than others.\n\nThis output schema follows the structure defined in the provided JSON object under `\"output_schema\"`.",
