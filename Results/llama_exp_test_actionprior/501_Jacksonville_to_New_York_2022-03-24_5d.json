The output consists of multiple candidate bundles, each represented as an object with several fields.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the structure:\n\n* `candidate_id`: A unique identifier for each bundle.\n* `reason`: A short string explaining why this particular bundle was generated.\n* `confidence`: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the model is in this bundle.\n* `gradient`: An object containing three fields:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of exclusion rules that were applied during generation, including phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge information.\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of penalties assigned to this bundle due to various features or characteristics, along with their impact on the overall score.\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of patches that were applied during retrieval, including phase, patch type (e.g., hotel price), and TTL.\n\nHere's an example candidate bundle:\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 11,\n  \"reason\": \"Hotel prices are reasonable\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"hotel\", \"rule\": \"price > $100\", \"ttl\": 2, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n      {\"phase\": \"edge\", \"rule\": \"distance > 500 miles\", \"ttl\": 1}\n    ],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"feature\", \"feature\": \"hotel_price\", \"delta\": -0.5},\n      {\"phase\": \"feature\", \"feature\": \"travel_time\", \"delta\": -0.2}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"hotel\", \"patch\": \"increase_price_by_10%\", \"ttl\": 1}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis example bundle has a confidence score of 0.8 and includes three hard exclusions (hotel price > $100 in New York, distance > 500 miles from edge) and two soft penalties (hotel price -0.5, travel time -0.2). It also has one retrieval patch (increase hotel price by 10% for the next hour).\n\nThis format allows you to analyze each candidate bundle and its associated confidence score, as well as understand why certain rules or features were applied during generation.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about this output or need help interpreting it further, feel free to ask!",
