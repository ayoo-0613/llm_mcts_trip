This is useful for understanding how to interpret and work with the results.\n\nSome possible questions you might have:\n\n* What are the candidate IDs, and what do they represent?\n* How does the confidence value relate to the quality of the solution?\n* What are hard exclusions, soft penalties, and retrieval patches in this context?\n\nTo answer these questions or extract specific information from the output, I'd be happy to help you drill down into the data.

It contains information about various candidate bundles and their associated costs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure:\n\n1. `bundle_candidate_list`: This is the main list containing all candidate bundles.\n2. `output_schema`: This defines the schema for each row in the output, including the fields that are present for each candidate bundle.\n\nLooking at the first few elements of `bundle_candidate_list`, we can see that they contain information about a specific candidate bundle, including:\n\n* `id` (integer): A unique identifier for this candidate bundle.\n* `bundle`: A list of city names that make up this bundle.\n* `lb_costs`: A dictionary containing the lower-bound costs for each phase (transportation, stay, and meal).\n* `feasibility`: A dictionary with two fields: `return_leg_exists` (boolean) and `hotel_feasible_all` (boolean).\n\nThe `output_schema` defines the structure of the output. It specifies that there are four main fields:\n\n* `candidate_id` (integer): The unique identifier for this candidate bundle.\n* `reason` (short string): A brief description or reason why this candidate was generated.\n* `confidence` (float in [0,1]): The confidence level associated with this candidate bundle.\n\nThe `gradient` field is a nested dictionary that contains three subfields:\n\n* `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples containing information about hard exclusions. Each tuple has four elements:\n\t+ `phase`: A string indicating the phase (e.g., transportation, stay, meal).\n\t+ `rule`: A string describing the exclusion rule.\n\t+ `ttl`: The time to live for this exclusion ( likely a timestamp).\n\t+ `city?`: An optional field that might indicate whether the exclusion applies only to certain cities.\n\t+ `edge?`: An optional field that might indicate whether the exclusion applies only to specific edges or routes.\n* `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing information about soft penalties. Each tuple has three elements:\n\t+ `phase`: A string indicating the phase (e.g., transportation, stay, meal).\n\t+ `feature`: A string describing the feature that was penalized.\n\t+ `delta`: The magnitude of the penalty applied to this feature.\n* `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing information about retrieval patches. Each tuple has three elements:\n\t+ `phase`: A string indicating the phase (e.g., transportation, stay, meal).\n\t+ `patch`: A string describing the patch or adjustment made during optimization.\n\t+ `ttl`: The time to live for this patch ( likely a timestamp).\n\nThis structure suggests that the output is related to an optimization algorithm that generates candidate bundles based on various constraints and preferences. The output schema provides metadata about each candidate bundle, including its unique identifier, confidence level, and reasons why it was generated.",

Filter the candidate bundles based on specific criteria (e.g., feasibility metrics or cost estimates).\n2. Analyze the risk and cost objects to identify potential areas for optimization.\n3. Visualize the bundle relationships using network diagrams or other visualization techniques.\n\nKeep in mind that without more context about the underlying algorithm and system, it's challenging to provide a more detailed explanation of the output.
