Filter the bundles by their LB costs and feasibility information to identify optimal solutions.\n2. Analyze the distribution of LB costs across different phases to understand where cost savings can be made.\n3. Identify patterns in the bundles that contribute to high LB costs (e.g., transportation costs, meal costs).\n4. Use the output schema to design a retrieval system or patching strategy for improving the LB costs.\n\nIf you have specific questions about this output or would like help with analysis, feel free to ask!",
