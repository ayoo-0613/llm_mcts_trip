We have set aside a budget of $3,700 for the trip. We're pet owners, so it's important for us to find pet-friendly accommodations. We prefer to use public transport or hire transportation, rather than driving ourselves. As for dining, we are interested in sampling Mediterranean, Italian, American, and Chinese cuisines.",
