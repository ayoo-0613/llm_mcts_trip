It contains multiple candidate IDs (represented by integers), each with associated reasons, confidences, and gradients.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure:\n\n1. `output_schema`: This defines the format of the output. It specifies the types of columns (`candidate_id`, `reason`, `confidence`) and their constraints.\n2. `candidates`: This is an array of objects, where each object represents a candidate solution. Each candidate has:\n\t* `id`: The unique identifier for this candidate (e.g., `1`, `6`, etc.)\n\t* `bundle`: An array of strings representing the cities included in this bundle\n\t* `lb_costs`: An object with four fields: `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`, and `bundle_lb_cost`. These represent the costs associated with each phase of the trip (transportation, stay, meals, and total).\n\t* `feasibility`: An object with two fields: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`. These indicate whether a return leg is present in the bundle and whether all hotel stays are feasible.\n3. Each candidate also has a nested object called `bundle_risk`, which contains:\n\t* `bottleneck_meal_slack`: The meal slack for the bottleneck city (i.e., the city with the most restrictive meal options)\n\t* `bottleneck_attr_slack`: The attribute slack for the bottleneck city (e.g., accommodations, transportation, etc.)\n\t* `bottleneck_hotel_price`: The hotel price for the bottleneck city\n\t* `bottleneck_city_meal`, `bottleneck_city_hotel`: These indicate which city has the most restrictive meal options and hotel prices.\n\t* `bottleneck_edge`: This represents the edge with the highest cost in the bundle.\n\nTo provide a more specific answer, please clarify what you would like to know or achieve with this data. Do you want to:\n\nA) Extract specific values from the output (e.g., a particular candidate's costs)?\nB) Understand the structure and meaning of each field?\nC) Analyze the relationships between fields (e.g., how do `bottleneck_meal_slack` and `lb_costs` relate)?\nD) Something else?",

These values represent the estimated costs or weights for each candidate solution.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object with two keys: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`.
