Here's a breakdown of the structure and content:\n\n**Top-level structure**\n\nThe output consists of an array of objects, each representing a candidate bundle.\n\n**Candidate object**\n\nEach candidate object has the following properties:\n\n* `id`: a unique integer identifier for the candidate\n* `bundle`: an array of city names, representing the bundle of cities being evaluated\n* `risk`: an object containing information about potential risks or issues with the bundle:\n\t+ `bottleneck_meal_slack`: the maximum meal slack (i.e., the amount by which meals are overbooked) for each city in the bundle\n\t+ `bottleneck_attr_slack`: the maximum attribute slack (i.e., the amount by which attributes are underprovided) for each city in the bundle\n\t+ `bottleneck_hotel_price`: the hotel price that is considered a bottleneck for the bundle\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_meal`, `bottleneck_city_hotel`: the city with the highest meal slack or hotel price, respectively\n* `city_summary`: an array of objects, each containing summary information about a city in the bundle:\n\t+ `days`, `nights`: the number of days and nights for which bookings are available in the city\n\t+ `hotel_min_price`: the minimum hotel price for the city\n\t+ `meal_slack`, `attr_slack`: the meal slack and attribute slack, respectively, for the city\n* `edge_summary`: an array of objects, each containing summary information about a transportation edge (i.e., a route between cities) in the bundle:\n\t+ `min_cost`: the minimum cost of traveling between two cities along this edge\n\t+ `blocked`: a boolean indicating whether the edge is blocked (e.g., due to road closures or construction)\n* `lb_costs`: an object containing lower bound costs for the bundle:\n\t+ `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`: the lower bound costs for transportation, stay, and meal, respectively\n\t+ `bundle_lb_cost`: the overall lower bound cost of the bundle\n* `feasibility`: an object indicating whether the bundle is feasible (i.e., has a valid solution):\n\t+ `return_leg_exists`: a boolean indicating whether there exists a return leg for each city in the bundle\n\t+ `hotel_feasible_all`: a boolean indicating whether all hotels in the bundle are feasible\n\n**Output schema**\n\nThe output schema provides metadata about the candidate objects, including:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer identifier for each candidate object\n* `reason`: a short string describing why each candidate was generated (e.g., \"high hotel price\")\n* `confidence`: a float between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level of each candidate's feasibility and risk assessment\n* `gradient`: an object containing information about the gradient of the optimization problem, including:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of phase-rule-city-edge tuples that are excluded from consideration due to hard constraints (e.g., \"city A has no hotels\")\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of phase-feature-delta tuples indicating soft penalties for each feature (e.g., \"hotel price is 10% above threshold\")\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of phase-patch-ttl tuples representing patches that can be applied to the candidate solution (e.g., \"add hotel at city B\")\n\nI hope this helps you understand the structure and content of this output!
