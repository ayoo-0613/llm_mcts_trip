      "raw": "This is a JSON object that represents the output of an optimization algorithm, likely in the context of route planning or travel recommendation. Here's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n**Output Schema**\n\nThe `output_schema` field defines the structure of the output data. It specifies four fields: `candidate_id`, `reason`, `confidence`, and `gradient`. The `gradient` field is an object with three subfields: `hard_exclusions`, `soft_penalties`, and `retrieval_patches`.\n\n**Gradient**\n\nThe `gradient` object contains information about the optimization process. It has three subfields:\n\n* `hard_exclusions`: a list of tuples containing phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge information. This field seems to represent hard exclusions or constraints that were applied during the optimization.\n* `soft_penalties`: a list of tuples containing phase, feature, and delta values. This field appears to represent soft penalties or weights assigned to certain features during the optimization.\n* `retrieval_patches`: a list of tuples containing phase, patch, and TTL information. This field may represent retrieval patches or modifications applied to the data during the optimization.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThe main object contains a list of candidates, each represented as an object with various fields:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the candidate.\n* `bundle`: a list of locations (cities or coordinates) that make up the candidate's route.\n* `lb_costs`: a set of costs associated with the candidate, including transport, stay, and meal costs.\n* `feasibility`: an object indicating whether the candidate has a return leg and if all hotels are feasible.\n\nEach candidate is evaluated based on various criteria, such as:\n\n* `bundle_risk`: an object containing information about the candidate's risk score, including bottleneck meal slack, attribute slack, hotel price, city meal slack, city hotel slack, and edge slack.\n* `city_summary` and `edge_summary`: objects providing detailed information about each location in the bundle and its connections to other locations.\n\nThe final output is likely a ranked list of candidates, with each candidate's ranking determined by their gradient scores.",
