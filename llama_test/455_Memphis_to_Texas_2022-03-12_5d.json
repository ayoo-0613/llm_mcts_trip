The structure of each element is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"bundle\": [\"Amarillo\", \"Lubbock\"],\n  \"risk\": {\"bottleneck_meal_slack\": 0, ...},\n  \"costs\": {\n    \"transport_lb_cost\": 2572.0,\n    \"stay_lb_cost\": 3078.0,\n    ...\n  },\n  \"feasibility\": {\"return_leg_exists\": true, \"hotel_feasible_all\": true}\n}\n```\n\n**Bundle Properties**\n\nEach candidate bundle has the following properties:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the bundle\n* `bundle`: an array of city names that make up the bundle\n* `risk`: an object representing the risk associated with the bundle (see below)\n\n**Risk Object**\n\nThe `risk` object contains various metrics that indicate the potential risks or challenges associated with the bundle. These include:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bottleneck_meal_slack\": 0,\n  \"bottleneck_attr_slack\": 17,\n  \"bottleneck_hotel_price\": 1029.0,\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n**Costs Object**\n\nEach candidate bundle also has a `costs` object that contains various metrics related to the costs associated with the bundle, including:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"transport_lb_cost\": 2572.0,\n  \"stay_lb_cost\": 3078.0,\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n**Feasibility Object**\n\nFinally, each candidate bundle has a `feasibility` object that indicates whether certain conditions are met (e.g., whether there is a return leg or if all hotels in the bundle can accommodate all travelers).\n\nOverall, this JSON object appears to be output from a machine learning model designed to rank candidate bundles based on various metrics, including risk, cost, and feasibility.",
