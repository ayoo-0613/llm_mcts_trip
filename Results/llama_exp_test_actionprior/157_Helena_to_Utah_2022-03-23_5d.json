This object describes the structure of the output data, including:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer identifier for each candidate\n* `reason`: a short string that explains why this candidate was selected\n* `confidence`: a float between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence in this candidate\n* `gradient`: an object that contains three lists: `hard_exclusions`, `soft_penalties`, and `retrieval_patches`. Each of these lists contains objects with different keys, such as `phase`, `rule`, `ttl`, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about this data!",

Data aggregation: Combine multiple bundles or metrics to gain a higher-level understanding.\n2. Feature engineering: Extract new features or transform existing ones to improve analysis.\n3.
