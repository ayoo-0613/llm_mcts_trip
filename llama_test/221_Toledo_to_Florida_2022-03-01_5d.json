      "raw": "This is a JSON output from a machine learning model, specifically an explanation of bundle suggestions for travel routes. The output contains various fields such as `candidate_id`, `reason`, `confidence`, and `gradient`. I'll break down the structure and provide some insights into what each field represents.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n1. **`candidate_id`:** A unique identifier for each bundle suggestion, represented as an integer.\n2. **`reason`:** A brief explanation or justification for why this particular bundle was suggested, stored as a short string.\n3. **`confidence`:** A float value between 0 and 1 that indicates the model's confidence in its recommendation. Higher values indicate higher confidence.\n4. **`gradient`:** This is an object containing three sub-objects: `hard_exclusions`, `soft_penalties`, and `retrieval_patches`.\n\n**Gradient Object:**\n\n1. **`hard_exclusions`:** A list of objects, each representing a hard exclusion rule applied to the bundle suggestion. Each object contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the journey (e.g., \"origin\", \"destination\", etc.).\n\t* `rule`: The specific rule that was excluded (e.g., \"no flights on Monday\").\n\t* `ttl`: A time-to-live value, which might indicate how long this exclusion applies.\n\t* `city?`: An optional field indicating the city affected by the exclusion.\n\t* `edge?`: An optional field specifying the edge of the journey impacted by the exclusion.\n2. **`soft_penalties`:** A list of objects representing soft penalties applied to the bundle suggestion. Each object contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the journey (e.g., \"origin\", \"destination\", etc.).\n\t* `feature`: The specific feature being penalized (e.g., \"flight duration\").\n\t* `delta`: The magnitude of the penalty.\n3. **`retrieval_patches`:** A list of objects, each representing a patch applied to improve retrieval accuracy. Each object contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the journey (e.g., \"origin\", \"destination\", etc.).\n\t* `patch`: The specific modification made to the model's output.\n\t* `ttl`: A time-to-live value, which might indicate how long this patch applies.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a bundle suggestion with ID 14, and its explanation contains the following fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 14,\n  \"reason\": \"Recommended due to low transportation costs.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"origin\", \"rule\": \"no flights on Monday\"}\n    ],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"destination\", \"feature\": \"flight duration\", \"delta\": -1}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the model recommended bundle ID 14 with a confidence of 0.9 due to low transportation costs. However, it also noted that flights from Toledo on Mondays are excluded (hard exclusion). Additionally, there is a soft penalty applied to the destination phase for flight duration (-1 unit).\n\nPlease note that the actual values and field names may vary depending on the specific model and problem being solved.",
