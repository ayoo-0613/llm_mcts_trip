      "raw": "This is a JSON output from an optimization or recommendation algorithm. It appears to be a list of candidate bundles with their respective costs and feasibility metrics.\n\nHere's a brief breakdown of the structure:\n\n* `output_schema`: This section defines the schema for the output data. It specifies the types and ranges of the fields that will be returned.\n* `bundles`: This is an array of objects, where each object represents a candidate bundle.\n\t+ Each bundle has several key-value pairs:\n\t\t- `id`: A unique identifier for the bundle (integer).\n\t\t- `bundle_risk`: An object with three properties: `bottleneck_meal_slack`, `bottleneck_attr_slack`, and `bottleneck_hotel_price`.\n\t\t- `city_summary` and `edge_summary`: Objects containing summary statistics for cities and edges in the bundle, respectively.\n\t\t- `lb_costs`: An object with four properties: `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`, and `bundle_lb_cost`.\n\t\t- `feasibility`: An object with two properties: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`.\n\nTo extract specific information from this output, you can use standard JSON parsing techniques. For example, to get the bundle with the lowest cost, you could iterate over the `bundles` array and compare the `bundle_lb_cost` values.\n\nHere's a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates how to extract the bundle with the lowest cost:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Assuming 'output' is the JSON string containing the output data\noutput = '''\n{\n    ...\n}\n'''\n\ndata = json.loads(output)\n\nmin_cost_bundle = min(data['bundles'], key=lambda x: x['lb_costs']['bundle_lb_cost'])\n\nprint(\"Bundle with lowest cost:\")\nprint(min_cost_bundle)\n```\nThis code loads the JSON string into a Python dictionary, defines a function to extract the bundle with the minimum `bundle_lb_cost` value using the `min()` function with a lambda expression as the key function, and then prints the selected bundle.",

Each bundle object has several key-value pairs:\n\t* `id`: A unique identifier for the bundle (e.g., 1, 13, etc.)\n\t* `bundle`: An array of destination cities (e.g., [\"New York\", \"Niagara Falls\"])\n\t* `bundle_risk`: An object with various risk metrics associated with the bundle (e.g., bottleneck meal slack, attr Slack)\n\t* `city_summary`: An object containing summary statistics for each city in the bundle (e.g., hotel prices, meal costs)\n\t* `edge_summary`: An object summarizing the transportation costs between cities in the bundle\n\t* `lb_costs`: A set of cost metrics associated with the bundle (transportation, stay, meal)\n\t* `feasibility`: An object containing feasibility metrics for the bundle (return leg exists, hotel feasible)\n\nTo extract meaningful insights from this data, you might want to:\n\n1. Filter the bundles by specific criteria (e.g., minimum travel time, maximum budget).\n2. Calculate summary statistics or aggregate values across all bundles.\n3. Visualize the bundles using a heat map, scatter plot, or other visualization techniques.\n\nIf you'd like help with any of these tasks, feel free to ask!",

It specifies that each candidate should have three attributes: `candidate_id`, `reason`, and `confidence`.\n3. **Gradient**: This is an object that provides additional information about each candidate's evaluation. It contains three sub-objects:\n\t* **Hard exclusions**: A list of rules that exclude a candidate from consideration.\n\t* **Soft penalties**: A list of features that penalize the candidate, along with their corresponding deltas (values).\n\t* **Retrieval patches**: A list of patches that can be applied to improve the candidate's evaluation.\n\nSome possible interpretations of this output include:\n\n1. **Ranking candidates**: The model outputs a ranking of candidate solutions based on their confidence scores.\n2. **Debugging and explaining models**: The gradient object provides insights into why certain candidates were selected or excluded, allowing for debugging and improvement of the model.\n3. **Post-processing and filtering**: The output can be used as input to further processing steps, such as filtering out low-confidence candidates or applying additional constraints.\n\nTo answer your original question, I'd need more context about what you're trying to accomplish with this output.
