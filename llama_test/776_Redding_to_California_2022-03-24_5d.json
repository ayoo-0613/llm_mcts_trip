We plan to embark on this journey between March 24th and March 28th, 2022. Our new budget is around $3,300. We require accommodations that allow visitors, and we enjoy a multitude of cuisines, including Indian, French, Mexican, and American. Instead of flying, we prefer alternative modes of transportation. Can you help organize this trip with these details in mind?",
