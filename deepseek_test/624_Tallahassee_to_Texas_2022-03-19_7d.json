      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which candidate_id is the best for the next MCTS attempt. The user provided a JSON with all the necessary details, so I need to parse that and make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, looking at the hard_rules, it says the candidate_id must be an integer in [0, 0], meaning only candidate_id 0 is allowed. So, there's no choice; I have to select id 0. But let me double-check other factors to ensure this makes sense.\n\nThe failure_report shows that the current bundle is [\"Austin\", \"Lubbock\", \"San Antonio\"], but the excluded_sample notes that a candidate was excluded because it's the same as the current bundle, which suggests there might be issues with overlapping cities. However, since we're only selecting from id 0, and its bundle is different ([\"Austin\", \"Amarillo\", \"San Antonio\"]), it avoids this problem.\n\nLooking at the city_summary for each city in candidate_id 0:\n- Austin has a hotel_min_price of $1142 with slack 0. That seems high but feasible.\n- Amarillo has a lower hotel price ($900) and no meal slack, which might be more budget-friendly.\n- San Antonio has the highest hotel cost at $1155 but some slack in meals.\n\nThe edge_summary shows all edges are unblocked, so no issues there. The lb_costs add up to a total of 16964, which is manageable given the current constraints.\n\nConsidering the gating_summary, it's using hard_gate with only one candidate left after exclusions. This means we have to go with id 0 despite any potential risks.\n\nThe gradient suggests some penalties like budget_risk and soft_penalty, but since all edges are clear and there's no dead-end city mentioned, these might not be critical issues. The confidence is set at 0.85, which is pretty high.\n\nPutting it all together, candidate_id 0 seems to be the only viable option given the constraints, so selecting it makes sense despite any minor penalties.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 0,\n  \"reason\": \"Only candidate with id 0 remains after exclusions.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"bundle\", \"feature\": \"budget_risk\", \"delta\": -0.1},\n      {\"phase\": \"edge\", \"feature\": \"soft_penalty\", \"delta\": -0.2}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which candidate_id to select for the next MCTS attempt. The user provided a JSON with all the necessary information, and I need to make sure I follow their instructions correctly.\n\nFirst, let's look at the task: Select the best candidate_id from the given candidates and output a FailureGradient. They specifically mentioned not to invent cities, so I should only choose based on the candidate_ids available.\n\nLooking at the hard_rules, it says the candidate_id must be an integer in [0, 0]. That means there's only one candidate available with id 0. So, my job is basically done because there are no other options to consider.\n\nBut wait, I should still check all the information provided to make sure everything aligns correctly and that selecting this candidate makes sense according to the given criteria.\n\nThe failure_report indicates some issues like missing flights, outbound, and return problems. The current_bottleneck shows high hotel prices in San Antonio ($1155) and a meal slack of 0 there as well. But looking at the candidates, candidate_id 0's bundle includes Austin, Lubbock, and San Antonio.\n\nIn the city_summary for each city:\n- Austin has a hotel_min_price of $1142 with some slacks.\n- Lubbock is cheaper at $1029.\n- San Antonio is more expensive again at $1155.\n\nThe edge_summary shows that all edges are unblocked, which is good because the user mentioned preferring candidates without blocked edges for flight failures. The feasibility checks also pass for return legs and hotels.\n\nSo, even though there's a high hotel cost in San Antonio, since all other aspects are feasible and no flights are blocked, candidate 0 seems like the best choice. There's only one option anyway, so selecting id 0 makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 0,\n  \"reason\": \"Only candidate available with bundle [Austin, Lubbock, San Antonio].\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": []\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt based on the given data. The task says I need to select only from candidates with id in [0, 0], so that means there's only one candidate here, which is id 0.\n\nLooking at the failure_report, the failed_phase is unknown, and there are some violations like missing_flight, outbound, and return. Also, the current_bundle includes Austin, Lubbock, and San Antonio. The gating_summary says that one bundle was excluded because it's the same as the current one, so only candidate 0 remains.\n\nThe candidate 0 has a bundle of [\"Austin\", \"Amarillo\", \"San Antonio\"]. I need to check if there are any dead_end_cities or blocked edges. From the edge_summary, all edges seem unblocked since they have min_cost and blocked is false for each. The city_summary shows that Austin, Amarillo, and San Antonio have hotel_min_price and other details but no immediate issues like being a dead end.\n\nThe task mentions preferring candidates without blocked edges, which this one satisfies. Also, there's no mention of dead_end_city in the failure_report, so avoiding it isn't necessary here. The hard_rules say to choose only by id, and since 0 is the only option, that's straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the gradient rules. The hard_exclusions must be from a specific list, but since all edges are unblocked, maybe there's nothing to exclude. Soft_penalties could include things like budget_risk or cost_ratio, but without specific numbers, it's hard to assign exact deltas.\n\nOverall, candidate_id 0 is the only option and seems feasible given the constraints.\n</think>\n\n{\"candidate_id\": 0, \"reason\": \"Only one candidate available after exclusions.\", \"confidence\": 1.0, \"gradient\": {\"hard_exclusions\": [], \"soft_penalties\": [], \"retrieval_patches\": []}}",
