Each object has the same structure as defined in `output_schema`.\n\nHere are some specific observations:\n\n1. **Candidate bundles**: There are 9 candidate bundles, each with its own set of costs and feasibility metrics (e.g., transportation cost, accommodation cost, meal cost).\n2. **Feasibility metrics**: The `feasibility` object contains two keys: `return_leg_exists` (a boolean indicating whether a return leg is feasible) and `hotel_feasible_all` (a boolean indicating whether all hotel stays are feasible).\n3. **Gradient**: This section provides additional information about the optimization process, including hard exclusions, soft penalties, and retrieval patches.\n4. **Costs**: The `lb_costs` object contains the lower bound costs for each candidate bundle, including transportation cost (`transport_lb_cost`), accommodation cost (`stay_lb_cost`), meal cost (`meal_lb_cost`), and total cost (`bundle_lb_cost`).\n\nTo extract specific information from this JSON object, I can help with questions like \"What is the confidence in the optimality of the first candidate bundle?\" or \"Which cities are excluded in the hard exclusions list for the 5th candidate bundle?\".",
