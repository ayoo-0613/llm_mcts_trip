It contains a list of candidate solutions (`candidates`) with various attributes and a schema that defines the structure of the output.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components:\n\n1. `output_schema`: This is a dictionary that defines the structure of the output. It specifies the types of each field in the output, such as `candidate_id` (integer), `reason` (short string), `confidence` (float between 0 and 1), and `gradient` (a nested dictionary with three fields: `hard_exclusions`, `soft_penalties`, and `retrieval_patches`).\n2. `candidates`: This is a list of candidate solutions, each represented as a dictionary. Each candidate has several attributes:\n\t* `id`: an integer identifier for the candidate\n\t* `bundle`: a list of city names (e.g., [\"Minneapolis\", \"Gustavus\", \"Duluth\"])\n\t* `bundle_risk`: a nested dictionary with various risk metrics (bottleneck meal slack, bottleneck attraction slack, etc.)\n\t* `city_summary`: a nested dictionary with city-level metrics (hotel min price, hotel slack, meal slack, etc.)\n\t* `edge_summary`: a nested dictionary with edge-level metrics (min cost, blocked)\n\t* `lb_costs`: a dictionary with transportation, stay, and meal costs\n\t* `feasibility`: a dictionary with boolean values indicating whether the candidate has a return leg and hotel feasible\n\nThe structure of this output is likely designed for efficient storage and retrieval in a database or for easy interpretation by an application.\n\nIf you have specific questions about how to interpret this output or would like help extracting particular information from it, feel free to ask!",

However, here's a sample Python code snippet that might help with some initial exploratory analysis:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Assuming 'response' is the JSON response string\nresponse = \"\"\"\n# Your JSON Response String Goes Here\n\"\"\"\n\ndata = json.loads(response)\n\n# Print all candidate solutions (bundles)\nfor i, solution in enumerate(data['candidates']):\n    print(f\"Candidate {i}:\")\n    for key, value in solution.items():\n        if key != 'feasibility':\n            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n    \n    # Example to access specific data points\n    print(f\"Bundled Risk: {solution['bundle_risk']['bottleneck_meal_slack']}\")\n    print(f\"City Summary for the first city in the bundle: {solution['city_summary'][0]}\")\n\n# Access LB costs and feasibility for each candidate\nfor i, solution in enumerate(data['candidates']):\n    print(f\"Candidate {i} - LB Costs: {solution['lb_costs']}, Feasibility: {solution['feasibility']}\")\n\n```\n\nThis code loads the JSON response into a Python dictionary, then iterates over each candidate solution (bundle), printing out various metrics and accessing specific data points. It also prints the LB costs and feasibility for each candidate.\n\nPlease note that you'll need to replace `# Your JSON Response String Goes Here` with your actual JSON string or use another method to load the JSON response into your Python script.",
