Each object contains four properties:\n\t+ **phase**: The phase (e.g., booking, itinerary) in which the exclusion was applied.\n\t+ **rule**: The specific exclusion rule used (e.g., \"no direct flights\").\n\t+ **ttl**: A time-to-live value indicating how long this exclusion will be in effect.\n\t+ **city?**: An optional property indicating whether the exclusion applies to a specific city (null if not applicable).\n* **soft_penalties**: An array of objects, each describing a soft penalty that has been applied to the candidate travel plan. Each object contains three properties:\n\t+ **phase**: The phase in which the penalty was applied.\n\t+ **feature**: A string indicating what feature or attribute is being penalized (e.g., \"flight duration\").\n\t+ **delta**: A floating-point value indicating the magnitude of the penalty.\n* **retrieval_patches**: An array of objects, each describing a retrieval patch that has been applied to the candidate travel plan. Each object contains three properties:\n\t+ **phase**: The phase in which the patch was applied.\n\t+ **patch**: A string describing the specific patch or adjustment made (e.g., \"add layover\").\n\t+ **ttl**: A time-to-live value indicating how long this patch will be in effect.\n\n**Schema**: The final property, `output_schema`, describes the schema of the output data. It contains three key-value pairs:\n\n* **candidate_id**: An integer field representing the unique identifier for each candidate travel plan.\n* **reason**: A short string field explaining why each particular travel plan was generated.\n* **confidence**: A floating-point value between 0 and 1, indicating how confident the algorithm is in the quality of each travel plan.\n\nOverall, this JSON object provides a detailed representation of the output of a travel planning algorithm, including information about candidate travel plans, exclusion rules, soft penalties, and retrieval patches.",
