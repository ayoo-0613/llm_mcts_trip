Our budget is now set at $5,400 for this trip. Our accommodations need to be rooms that are not shared, and we would like to have the liberty to host parties. We're hoping to enjoy a variety of cuisines, including Indian, American, French, and Mexican during our visit. Can you help us with the itinerary?",
