It specifies that there are four types of objects:\n\n* `candidate_id`: A unique identifier for each candidate solution (e.g. 13).\n* `reason`: A short string describing why a particular candidate solution was generated.\n* `confidence`: A floating-point value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level in the candidate solution.\n* `gradient`: An object containing three types of data:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples that specify hard exclusions for each phase, rule, TTL, city, or edge (e.g. [\"phase\", \"rule\", \"ttl\", \"city?\", \"edge?\"]).\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples that specify soft penalties for each phase, feature, and delta.\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples that specify retrieval patches for each phase, patch, and TTL.\n\nNote that this is a complex data structure, and it may be challenging to extract meaningful insights from the data without additional context or information about the underlying algorithmic model.
