It defines four fields:\n\t+ `candidate_id`: an integer identifier for each candidate solution.\n\t+ `reason`: a short string explaining why a particular candidate was chosen (e.g., \"best fit\").\n\t+ `confidence`: a float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is in its choice.\n\t+ `gradient`: an object containing three fields:\n\t\t- `hard_exclusions`: a list of rules or constraints that were excluded from consideration.\n\t\t- `soft_penalties`: a list of feature values that were penalized during optimization.\n\t\t- `retrieval_patches`: a list of patches or corrections applied to the candidate solution.\n\nTo extract useful information from this output, you might want to:\n\n1. Inspect the `candidates` list and select the top-performing solutions based on their `confidence` scores.\n2. Analyze the `reason` field for each selected candidate to understand why it was chosen.\n3. Investigate the `gradient` object to see which constraints or penalties were applied during optimization.\n\nIf you have specific questions about interpreting this output, feel free to ask!",

It has several key-value pairs:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer identifier for each candidate solution\n* `reason`: a short string describing why a particular solution was selected (or not)\n* `confidence`: a float value between 0 and 1 representing the confidence in the solution\n* `gradient`: an object with three sub-objects:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of tuples, each containing four values: phase, rule, TTL, city?, edge?\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of tuples, each containing three values: phase, feature, delta\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of tuples, each containing three values: phase, patch, TTL\n\nThis structure suggests that the algorithm is optimizing bundle trips between cities, taking into account transportation, stay, meal costs, and hotel feasibility. The output schema indicates that the solution is accompanied by a confidence score, a reason for selection (or not), and a gradient representing hard exclusions, soft penalties, and retrieval patches.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific aspects of this structure or contents!",
