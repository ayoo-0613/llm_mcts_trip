It includes four fields:\n\t+ `candidate_id`: An integer identifier for each candidate solution.\n\t+ `reason`: A short string explaining why this particular solution was chosen (or not).\n\t+ `confidence`: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is in its choice.\n\t+ `gradient`: This field contains three sub-objects that provide additional information about the optimization process:\n\t\t- `hard_exclusions`: A list of phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge tuples that were excluded from consideration due to hard constraints or rules.\n\t\t- `soft_penalties`: A list of phase, feature, delta tuples that represent soft penalties applied during the optimization process. These penalties can be adjusted or modified in future iterations.\n\t\t- `retrieval_patches`: A list of phase, patch, TTL tuples that describe patches applied to the retrieval process (e.g., data augmentation or correction).\n* `data`: This is an array of objects, where each object represents a candidate solution. Each object has the same structure as defined in the `output_schema`, with additional fields depending on the specific solution.\n\nTo extract meaningful insights from this output, you would need to analyze the `candidate_id` and `reason` fields for each solution, along with the corresponding values of `confidence` and the sub-objects within `gradient`. This might involve:\n\n1. Filtering solutions based on their confidence scores or reasons.\n2. Analyzing the hard exclusions and soft penalties applied during optimization to understand which constraints or rules had the most significant impact.\n3. Examining the retrieval patches to identify any data augmentation or correction methods used.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a high-level overview, and without more context about the specific algorithm or model generating this output, it's difficult to provide more detailed guidance on extracting insights from this data.",

Which candidate itineraries have the lowest estimated costs?\n2. What are the risk factors associated with each candidate itinerary?\n3. How do the summary information about cities and edges in each itinerary differ?\n4.
