      "raw": "This is a JSON object that represents the output of an optimization algorithm. It contains information about candidate solutions to an optimization problem.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the different fields in the output:\n\n1. `candidates`: This field contains a list of candidate solutions to the optimization problem. Each candidate is represented as a dictionary with several key-value pairs.\n2. `output_schema`: This field defines the structure of the output data. It specifies the names and types of each field in the output, which can be used for further processing or visualization.\n\nTo extract useful information from this object, you would need to:\n\n1. Identify the relevant fields in the `candidates` list that correspond to the problem at hand.\n2. Extract the values associated with these fields for each candidate solution.\n3. Perform any necessary transformations or calculations on these values to obtain the desired insights.\n\nFor example, if you're interested in finding the candidate solution with the highest confidence score, you would extract the `confidence` field from each dictionary in the `candidates` list and find the maximum value.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this using Python:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON object from the string\noutput = json.loads(json_string)\n\n# Extract the candidates list\ncandidates = output['candidates']\n\n# Initialize max_confidence to a low value (e.g. 0)\nmax_confidence = 0\n\n# Find the candidate with the highest confidence score\nfor candidate in candidates:\n    if candidate['confidence'] > max_confidence:\n        max_confidence = candidate['confidence']\n        best_candidate = candidate\n\nprint(f\"Best candidate: {best_candidate}\")\nprint(f\"Confidence: {max_confidence}\")\n```\nThis code loads the JSON object from a string, extracts the `candidates` list, and then iterates over each candidate to find the one with the highest confidence score. The resulting best candidate is printed out along with its confidence value.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements.",

      "raw": "This is a JSON object that represents the output of a recommendation system or a model that generates candidate solutions. It contains various information about each candidate solution, including its ID, reason for inclusion, confidence score, and a gradient object with several components.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the fields:\n\n1. `output_schema`: This field defines the schema of the output data. It specifies the types and ranges of values that can be expected in the output.\n2. `candidate_id`: An integer representing the unique ID of each candidate solution.\n3. `reason`: A short string describing why each candidate was included.\n4. `confidence`: A floating-point number between 0 and 1 indicating the model's confidence in each candidate solution.\n\nThe gradient object has three components:\n\n1. `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples containing information about hard exclusions, which are rules that completely eliminate a candidate from consideration. Each tuple contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the decision-making process (e.g., \"feature selection\").\n\t* `rule`: The specific rule that triggered the exclusion.\n\t* `ttl` (Time To Live): A time limit for the exclusion to apply.\n\t* `city?`: An optional field indicating if the exclusion applies only to a specific city.\n\t* `edge?`: An optional field indicating if the exclusion applies only to a specific edge or route.\n2. `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing information about soft penalties, which reduce the confidence score but do not completely eliminate a candidate. Each tuple contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the decision-making process (e.g., \"feature selection\").\n\t* `feature`: The specific feature that contributed to the penalty.\n\t* `delta`: The amount by which the confidence score was reduced.\n3. `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing information about retrieval patches, which modify the candidate solutions during the retrieval phase. Each tuple contains:\n\t* `phase`: The phase of the decision-making process (e.g., \"feature selection\").\n\t* `patch`: The specific patch applied to the candidate solution.\n\t* `ttl` (Time To Live): A time limit for the patch to apply.\n\nThe `candidates` field is an array of objects, each representing a candidate solution. Each object contains all the fields mentioned above, including `candidate_id`, `reason`, and the gradient object.\n\nTo extract specific information from this JSON object, you can use standard JSON parsing techniques, such as using a library like `json` in Python or `jq` in the shell. For example:\n```python\nimport json\n\ndata = '''\n... (insert JSON object here) ...\n'''\n\ncandidates = json.loads(data)['candidates']\n\nfor candidate in candidates:\n    print(f\"Candidate {candidate['candidate_id']}:\")\n    print(f\"  Reason: {candidate['reason']}\")\n    print(f\"  Confidence: {candidate['confidence']}\")\n    print(f\"  Hard exclusions: {[x for x in candidate['gradient']['hard_exclusions']]}\")\n    print(f\"  Soft penalties: {[x for x in candidate['gradient']['soft_penalties']]}\")\n    print(f\"  Retrieval patches: {[x for x in candidate['gradient']['retrieval_patches']]}\\n\")\n```\nThis code extracts the `candidates` field from the JSON object and then iterates over each candidate, printing out its ID, reason, confidence score, and gradient components.",
