We'll be bringing our pets along, so places with pet-friendly rules are a must. We have a diverse palate and are interested in trying Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, and French cuisines. As for our stay, we require accommodations that are pet-friendly. Please note, we won't be self-driving and would prefer other modes of transportation.",
