This suggests that some solutions have been excluded due to hard constraints or rules.\n\t\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of tuples with phase, feature, and delta values. These represent soft penalties or trade-offs made in the optimization process.\n\t\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of tuples with phase, patch, and TTL information. This may relate to adjustments or patches applied during the retrieval process.\n\nTo interpret this JSON object further, I'd need more context about the specific problem domain (e.g., logistics, scheduling, resource allocation) and the underlying optimization algorithm used to generate these candidate solutions.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like me to clarify specific parts of the JSON, feel free to ask!",

Each bundle in the array is an object with keys that match those described in the `output_schema`.\n\nTo give you a better idea of what this data looks like, here's a simplified representation of one of the candidate bundles:\n```\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 1,\n  \"reason\": \"Bundle generated based on proximity to Norfolk\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [{\"phase\": \"morning\", \"rule\": \"no_breakfast\"}],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [{\"phase\": \"evening\", \"feature\": \"traffic_congestion\", \"delta\": -0.1}],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": [{\"phase\": \"lunch\", \"patch\": \"food_recommendation\", \"ttl\": 30}]\n  },\n  \"bundle\": [\"Belleville\", \"Chicago\", \"Peoria\"]\n}\n```\nLet me know if you'd like me to help with anything specific, such as parsing this data or extracting certain attributes.",

Each tuple includes phase, rule, TTL (time-to-live), city, and edge.\n\t* `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing information about soft penalties, which are factors that reduce the score of a candidate. Each tuple includes phase, feature, and delta.\n\t* `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing information about retrieval patches, which are modifications to improve the candidate bundle. Each tuple includes phase, patch, and TTL.\n\nThe dataset has 13 rows (candidates), each with a unique `candidate_id` and corresponding values for the other fields.\n\nHere is an example of how you could parse this data using Python:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON data into a Python dictionary\ndata = json.loads(json_string)\n\n# Accessing individual candidates\nfor candidate in data['bundle_candidates']:\n    print(f\"Candidate ID: {candidate['candidate_id']}\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {candidate['reason']}\")\n    print(f\"Confidence: {candidate['confidence']}\")\n\n# Accessing gradient information for a specific candidate\nprint(candidate['gradient'])\nprint(f\"Hard exclusions: {candidate['gradient']['hard_exclusions']}\")\nprint(f\"Soft penalties: {candidate['gradient']['soft_penalties']}\")\nprint(f\"Retrieval patches: {candidate['gradient']['retrieval_patches']}\")\n\n# Assuming you want to extract all candidate IDs\ncandidate_ids = [candidate['candidate_id'] for candidate in data['bundle_candidates']]\nprint(candidate_ids)\n```\nPlease note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify it based on your specific use case.
