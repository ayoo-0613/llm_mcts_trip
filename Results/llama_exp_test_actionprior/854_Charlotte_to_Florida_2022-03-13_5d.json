We're starting from Charlotte and the travel dates are from March 13th to March 17th, 2022. Our budget is now $9,100, and we'd like accommodations where we can have entire rooms to ourselves. We're also food lovers who are excited to experience Mediterranean, Chinese, French, and American cuisines during our trip. For transportation, we prefer not to self-drive.",
