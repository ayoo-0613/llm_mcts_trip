Each city object has properties such as `hotel_min_price`, `meal_slack`, and `attr_slack`.\n\t+ `edge_summary`: An array of objects, each representing an edge (i.e., a connection between two cities) in the bundle. Each edge object has properties such as `min_cost` and `blocked`.\n\t+ `lb_costs`: An object with various cost metrics associated with the bundle.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object with properties indicating whether a return leg exists and if all hotels are feasible.\n\n**Schema**\n\nThe schema defines the structure and types of data in the output. It includes information about the candidate ID, reason, confidence, and various types of scores and penalties.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with something specific related to this data (e.g., extracting certain values or understanding a particular aspect of the schema), please let me know!",
