A bundle is an ordered collection of cities that are considered for travel together.\n\n2. **City Summary**: Each city within a bundle has its own summary, which includes:\n   - `days` and `nights`: The duration of stay in the city.\n   - `hotel_min_price`, `meal_slack`, and `min_meal_cost`: Information related to food and accommodation costs or estimates.\n   - `attr_slack`: A measure of the amount by which a feature's value has slack, possibly indicating some flexibility.\n\n3. **Edge Summary**: Each edge (or travel route) within a bundle is also summarized with:\n   - `min_cost`, which appears to be the estimated cost for traveling between two cities.\n\n4. **LB Costs**: This includes several types of costs or penalties that have been calculated:\n   - `transport_lb_cost`\n   - `stay_lb_cost`\n   - `meal_lb_cost`\n   - `bundle_lb_cost`\n\n5. **Feasibility**: A boolean flag indicating whether a return leg exists for each bundle.\n\n6. **Output Schema**: This defines the structure of the output, including data types and possible values for each field.\n   \n7. **Candidate ID**, **Reason**, and **Confidence** seem to relate to the decision-making process behind selecting bundles or evaluating their feasibility.",

      "raw": "This is a JSON output of a travel planning algorithm. It contains a list of candidate bundles (sets of destinations) for a given trip, along with their associated costs and feasibility metrics.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n1. **candidate_bundles**: This is an array of objects, each representing a candidate bundle.\n2. Each bundle object has the following properties:\n\t* **bundle_id**: A unique identifier for the bundle.\n\t* **bundle**: An array of destinations (cities) in the bundle.\n\t* **lb_costs**: An object containing various cost metrics for the bundle, such as transportation costs (`transport_lb_cost`), accommodation costs (`stay_lb_cost`), and meal costs (`meal_lb_cost`). These values are likely calculated based on historical data or other sources.\n3. The output schema at the end of the JSON defines the structure of each candidate bundle object.\n\nTo extract specific insights from this data, you could use tools like `jq`, a command-line JSON processor. For example:\n\n```bash\n# Extract all bundle IDs and their associated costs\njq '.candidate_bundles[] | .bundle_id + \": \" + (.lb_costs.transport_lb_cost // 0) + \", \" + (.lb_costs.stay_lb_cost // 0)' input.json\n\n# Get the candidate with the lowest total cost (transportation + accommodation)\njq '.candidate_bundles | sort_by(.lb_costs.transport_lb_cost + .lb_costs.stay_lb_cost)[0]' input.json\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a starting point, and you'll need to understand the specific requirements of your project to extract meaningful insights from this data.",
