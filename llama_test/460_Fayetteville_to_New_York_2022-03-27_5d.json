These represent the \"risks\" associated with this candidate bundle.\n\t+ `lb_costs`: An object with four properties: `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`, and `bundle_lb_cost`. These represent some kind of lower bound or cost metric for this candidate bundle.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object with two properties: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`. These indicate whether certain conditions are met for this candidate bundle.\n\nSome other notes:\n\n* The `output_schema` property at the end is a description of the structure and types of data in this output. It's not part of the actual output, but rather a way to document what each field means.\n* Some of the values in this JSON object appear to be generated by some algorithm or process, rather than being explicit user inputs.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about this output, feel free to ask!",

The actual values in these objects depend on the specific problem being solved and the algorithm used.\n\nIf you'd like to extract specific information from this output or analyze it further, please let me know what you're interested in and I'll do my best to help!",
