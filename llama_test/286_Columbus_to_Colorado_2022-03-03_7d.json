Exclusions: Features or constraints that were explicitly excluded from consideration.\n2. Penalties: Features with soft penalties that are still considered but with a reduced score.\n3. Retrieval patches: Patches applied during the retrieval process to improve the solution.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to help with anything specific, such as interpreting these outputs or implementing them in code!",
