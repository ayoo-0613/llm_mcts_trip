I'll break down the structure of this object for you.\n\n**Top-level keys:**\n\n* `candidates`: an array of objects representing different candidate bundles\n* `output_schema`: an object defining the schema for output data (in case the user wants to extract specific information from it)\n\n**`candidates` array:**\n\nEach element in this array is a separate bundle with its own set of attributes. The keys within each bundle are:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the candidate bundle\n* `bundle`: an object representing the bundle, which typically contains two or more locations (e.g., cities) as key-value pairs (e.g., `Fayetteville` → `[...data about Fayetteville...]`)\n* `lb_costs`: an object with four keys: `transport_lb_cost`, `stay_lb_cost`, `meal_lb_cost`, and `bundle_lb_cost`, which contain estimated costs for each bundle\n* `feasibility`: an object with two keys: `return_leg_exists` and `hotel_feasible_all`, indicating whether a return trip is possible and if hotels are feasible for each location in the bundle, respectively\n\n**`output_schema` object:**\n\nThis object defines the structure of output data that might be extracted from the candidate bundles. The keys within this object are:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer representing the candidate's ID\n* `reason`: a short string explaining why a particular candidate was selected (or not)\n* `confidence`: a float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is in its recommendation\n* `gradient`: an object with three keys:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of objects containing information about hard exclusions, such as which phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, or edge was excluded\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of objects containing information about soft penalties, including the phase, feature, and delta associated with each penalty\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of objects containing information about retrieval patches, including the phase, patch, and TTL associated with each patch\n\nThis is quite a complex structure.
