Here's a breakdown of the structure and some key insights:\n\n**Top-level structure**\n\n* The data is wrapped in an object with a single property: `bundles`.\n* The value of this property is an array of objects, where each object represents a candidate bundle.\n\n**Candidate Bundle Object**\n\n* Each candidate bundle has several properties:\n\t+ `id`: A unique integer identifier for the bundle.\n\t+ `bundle_risk`: An object containing risk information about the bundle. It has four properties:\n\t\t- `bottleneck_meal_slack`: The meal slack value for the bottleneck city in the bundle.\n\t\t- `bottleneck_attr_slack`: The attribute slack value for the bottleneck city in the bundle.\n\t\t- `bottleneck_hotel_price`: The hotel price for the bottleneck city in the bundle.\n\t\t- `bottleneck_city_meal`, `bottleneck_city_hotel`, and `bottleneck_edge`: These properties contain information about the bottleneck city in the bundle (meal, hotel, and edge).\n\t+ `city_summary`: An object containing summary statistics for each city in the bundle. Each city has several properties:\n\t\t- `days` and `nights`: The number of days and nights the traveler will stay in the city.\n\t\t- `hotel_min_price`, `hotel_slack`, `meal_slack`, `min_meal_cost`, and `attr_slack`: These properties contain hotel, meal, and attribute-related statistics for the city.\n\t+ `edge_summary`: An object containing information about the edges (connections) between cities in the bundle. Each edge has several properties:\n\t\t- `min_cost` and `blocked`: The minimum cost and blockage status of the edge.\n\t+ `lb_costs`: An object containing lower bound costs for the bundle, including transport, stay, meal, and total costs.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object containing feasibility information about the bundle. It has two properties:\n\t\t- `return_leg_exists`: A boolean indicating whether a return leg exists in the bundle.\n\t\t- `hotel_feasible_all`: A boolean indicating whether all hotel stays are feasible.\n\n**Output Schema**\n\n* The `output_schema` property contains a description of the output format, including the types and ranges for each property. It's mostly self-explanatory, but here are some key points:\n\t+ `candidate_id`, `reason`, and `confidence`: These properties are related to the recommendation process.\n\t+ `gradient`: This object contains three lists: `hard_exclusions`, `soft_penalties`, and `retrieval_patches`. Each list item has several properties (phase, rule, TTL, city?, edge?), which seem to be related to the optimization algorithm.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a complex data structure, and there might be additional insights or details hidden within the objects. If you have specific questions about any of these topics, feel free to ask!",
