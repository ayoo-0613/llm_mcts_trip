The data is structured into several sections:\n\n1. **candidate_sets**: This section contains an array of objects, each representing a set of recommended candidates (e.g., hotel and activity bundles) for a specific query.\n2. **output_schema**: This section defines the structure of the output data, including the format of the candidate sets.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key elements in each object within the `candidate_sets` array:\n\n* **id** (integer): A unique identifier for each candidate set.\n* **bundle** (array): An array of objects representing the recommended bundles, which contain:\n\t+ **city**: The city(ies) associated with the bundle (e.g., \"Martha's Vineyard\").\n\t+ **edge**: The edge(s) connecting the cities in the bundle (e.g., a flight or ferry route).\n* **bundle_risk** (object): An object containing risk-related information for each bundle, including:\n\t+ **bottleneck_meal_slack**: The meal slack value for the bottleneck city in the bundle.\n\t+ **bottleneck_attr_slack**: The attribute slack value for the bottleneck city in the bundle.\n* **city_summary** (object): An object summarizing the city(ies) involved in each bundle, including:\n\t+ **hotel_min_price**: The minimum hotel price for the city.\n\t+ **meal_slack**: The meal slack value for the city.\n\t+ **attr_slack**: The attribute slack value for the city.\n* **edge_summary** (object): An object summarizing the edge(s) connecting each city in the bundle, including:\n\t+ **min_cost**: The minimum cost of traveling between cities.\n\t+ **blocked**: A boolean indicating whether the edge is blocked or not.\n* **lb_costs** (object): An object containing lower bound costs for each phase of the optimization process, including:\n\t+ **transport_lb_cost**: The transport lower bound cost.\n\t+ **stay_lb_cost**: The stay lower bound cost.\n\t+ **meal_lb_cost**: The meal lower bound cost.\n* **feasibility** (object): An object indicating whether a feasible solution exists for each candidate set, including:\n\t+ **return_leg_exists**: A boolean indicating whether a return leg is available.\n\nTo extract insights from this data, you could analyze the relationships between candidate sets, city and edge attributes, and risk-related values. For example:\n\n1. Identify patterns in city and edge combinations across different candidate sets.\n2. Analyze the impact of risk-related factors (e.g., bottleneck meal slack) on bundle recommendations.\n3. Investigate correlations between lower bound costs and candidate set attributes (e.g., hotel prices).\n4. Evaluate the feasibility of solutions for each candidate set to identify potential issues or bottlenecks.\n\nKeep in mind that this data is likely generated by a complex optimization algorithm, so interpreting the results will require an understanding of both the underlying algorithm and the context in which it's being applied.",

These might be used for debugging or post-processing.\n4. **Schema**: The response includes an `output_schema` section that defines the structure of the output data.
