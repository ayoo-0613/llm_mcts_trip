We're setting off from Palm Springs and aim to venture through 3 different cities in Texas from March 11th to March 17th, 2022. We have allocated a budget of $6,200 for this trip. In terms of accommodations, we're seeking rooms that are not shared, and it's important that the places allow visitors. We'd love to savor a mix of Mediterranean, American, Chinese, and Italian cuisines during our journey.",
