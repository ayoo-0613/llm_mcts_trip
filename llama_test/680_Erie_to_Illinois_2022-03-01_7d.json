Each exclusion has a phase, rule, TTL, city, and edge associated with it.\n\t\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of soft penalties (features) applied to this candidate. Each penalty has a phase, feature, and delta value associated with it.\n\t\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of patches that can be used to improve the candidate. Each patch has a phase, type, and TTL associated with it.\n2. `bundle_list`: This section contains an array of candidate bundles.\n\t* Each bundle is represented as an object with the following properties:\n\t\t+ `id`: The integer ID for this particular candidate bundle.\n\t\t+ `bundle_risk`: An object containing risk-related information (bottleneck meal slack, bottleneck attribute slack, etc.).\n\t\t+ `city_summary`: An object summarizing city-related information (min price, slack values, etc.) for each city in the bundle.\n\t\t+ `edge_summary`: An object summarizing edge-related information (minimum cost) between cities in the bundle.\n\t\t+ `lb_costs`: A dictionary containing costs associated with this candidate bundle.\n\nTo extract specific insights from this output, you may want to:\n\n* Filter the candidate list based on certain criteria (e.g., minimum confidence level).\n* Compute aggregate statistics (e.g., average bundle cost) across all candidates.\n* Analyze the gradient information to understand why certain bundles were generated or penalized.",

      "raw": "This is a JSON output from a machine learning model that appears to be performing route optimization or itinerary planning. The format is quite complex, but I'll try to break it down for you:\n\n**Data Structure**\n\nThe main object has the following properties:\n\n* `output_schema`: This defines the structure of the output data.\n* `bundles`: This is an array of objects, each representing a candidate bundle (i.e., a set of routes or itineraries).\n\n**Bundle Object**\n\nEach bundle object has the following properties:\n\n* `id`: A unique identifier for the bundle.\n* `bundle_risk`: An object that describes the risk associated with this bundle. It contains several sub-properties:\n\t+ `bottleneck_meal_slack`: The slack value for meal planning (e.g., how much extra time is available for meals).\n\t+ `bottleneck_attr_slack`: The slack value for attraction planning (e.g., how much extra time is available for attractions).\n\t+ `bottleneck_hotel_price`: The hotel price that is being optimized.\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_meal`: The city where the meal planning bottleneck occurs.\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_hotel`: The city where the hotel price optimization occurs.\n\t+ `bottleneck_edge`: The edge (route) where the risk is highest.\n* `city_summary`: An object that summarizes the cities involved in this bundle. It contains several sub-properties:\n\t+ `days`: The number of days spent in each city.\n\t+ `nights`: The number of nights spent in each city.\n\t+ `hotel_min_price`: The minimum hotel price for each city.\n\t+ `meal_slack`: The slack value for meal planning (e.g., how much extra time is available for meals).\n* `edge_summary`: An object that summarizes the routes involved in this bundle. It contains several sub-properties:\n\t+ `min_cost`: The minimum cost of each route.\n\t+ `blocked`: A boolean indicating whether the route is blocked or not.\n\n**Output Schema**\n\nThe output schema defines the structure of the output data. It has three main sections:\n\n* `candidate_id`: An integer representing the candidate ID.\n* `reason`: A short string describing why this bundle was selected.\n* `confidence`: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the model is in its selection.\n\nThe gradient section contains several sub-properties, including:\n\n* `hard_exclusions`: A list of tuples containing phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge information. These represent hard exclusions or constraints.\n* `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing phase, feature, delta values. These represent soft penalties or trade-offs.\n\n**Context**\n\nBased on the structure and content of this data, it appears that this is a machine learning model designed to optimize routes or itineraries for travelers. The model takes into account various factors such as meal planning, attraction planning, hotel prices, and route costs to select the most optimal bundle. The output schema suggests that the model provides a confidence score and a reason for its selection, which can be useful for further analysis or decision-making.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about this data or need help interpreting it, feel free to ask!",
