      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, I need to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt based on the given data. The task requires me to choose only from candidates with IDs 0 to 6 and output a JSON with specific keys: candidate_id, reason, confidence, gradient.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. There are several candidates each with their own bundle of cities, risks, edge summaries, and feasibility details. I need to evaluate these based on the failure_report and gating_summary provided.\n\nLooking at the failure_report:\n- The failed phase is unknown.\n- Dead_end_city is null, so that's not a concern right now.\n- Current_bundle includes \"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\".\n- Bottleneck information points to specific cities and edges with certain slacks and costs. For example, the bottleneck edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" with min_cost 418.\n\nGating_summary shows that only one candidate is excluded (id=5), but all others are included, so I have 7 candidates to consider.\n\nNow, looking at each candidate:\n\n0: Bundle [\"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\"]\n- The edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" has a min cost of 418.\n- Edge \"Provo->?\" is not specified but could be relevant.\n\n1: Similar to 0, same bundle. Same issues as 0?\n\n2: Different bundle; might introduce more complexity but not sure about the impact.\n\n3: Includes Cedar City and Ogden. Not sure how this affects the current path.\n\n4: Includes Salt Lake City and Cedar City. Again, different from the current bundle.\n\n5: Excluded, so ignore.\n\n6: Same as 0 and others? Let me check.\n\nI think the main issue is the bottleneck edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\". So I should look for candidates that have a lower min_cost on this edge or perhaps don't rely heavily on it. However, all candidates except 5 include Ogden in their bundles, so they all might share this bottleneck.\n\nBut looking at candidate_id=0:\n- Their bundle includes the same cities as current_bundle: \"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\".\n- The edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" has a min cost of 418. Maybe this is higher than other candidates?\n\nWait, checking all candidates:\n\nCandidate 0's edge summary:\n- Sun Valley->Ogden: 418\n- Provo->Ogden or others? Not specified, but maybe the total cost could be high.\n\nCandidates 2,3,4,6 have different bundles but include Ogden. Maybe their edges don't involve Sun Valley as much?\n\nWait, candidate_id=5 is excluded because of some failure in edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\", perhaps due to higher costs or delays.\n\nTherefore, selecting a candidate that avoids the Sun Valley->Ogden edge might be better, but all candidates except 5 include Ogden. So maybe I should look for other factors like meal slack and hotel prices.\n\nLooking at city_summary for each candidate:\n\nCandidate 0:\n- Salt Lake City: meal slack 19\n- Provo: not in the bundle? Or is it?\n\nWait, no, candidate 0's bundle is [\"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\"].\n\nSo Provo has hotel_min_price 82 (I think based on earlier data), but wait in the data for candidate_id=5, Provo isn't mentioned. Wait, maybe I need to look at each candidate's city_summary.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor example, candidate_id=0:\ncity_summary includes \"Ogden\", \"Provo\" and \"Salt Lake City\".\n\nEach has their own slacks and min costs.\n\nI think the main factor is the bottleneck edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\". Since all candidates except 5 have this edge, but some might have lower costs on it. Wait, candidate_id=0's edge cost is 418, while others:\n\nCandidate 2: Sun Valley->Ogden is 418? Or is that different?\n\nWait, looking at each candidate's edge_summary.\n\nCandidate 0:\nedges include \"Sun Valley->Ogden\": min_cost 418\n\nCandidate 1:\nSame bundle as 0, so likely same edges and costs.\n\nCandidate 2: bundle [\"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\"]\n- Edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" is not present? Or does it exist?\n\nWait no, candidate 2's edge_summary includes \"Sun Valley->Salt Lake City\":44, \"Salt Lake City->Vernal\":278, etc. So they might have a different path.\n\nSimilarly, candidate 3: bundle [\"Ogden\", \"Cedar City\", \"Salt Lake City\"]\n- Their edges include \"Sun Valley->Ogden\":418, so same issue as others.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to find candidates that don't rely on the expensive edge. But all except 5 have this edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should prioritize candidates with lower total lb costs or better feasibility.\n\nLooking at candidate_id=0: transport_lb_cost 638, stay_lb 726, meal 190\n\nCandidate 1: same as 0?\n\nWait no, looking back:\n\nEach candidate has their own lb_costs. Let's compare them.\n\nI think the best candidate would be the one with the lowest total lb cost and minimal reliance on the bottleneck edge.\n\nBut since all have the same edge except 5, which is excluded, perhaps I need to look for another metric.\n\nWait, maybe the confidence comes from how well the candidate avoids hard exclusions. Since none of the candidates except 5 are excluded, but some might have higher soft penalties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the candidate with the lowest meal slack or better hotel prices is better.\n\nBut it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I should choose the candidate that doesn't include Provo since in the failure_report, the current bundle includes Provo, which may be causing issues. So looking for a candidate without Provo might be better.\n\nLooking at candidates:\n\n- 0: has Provo\n- 1: same as 0\n- 2: no Provo (has Vernal)\n- 3: no Provo (Cedar City)\n- 4: no Provo\n- 5: excluded\n- 6: no Provo\n\nSo candidates 2,3,4,6 don't include Provo. Maybe these are better.\n\nBut I need to check if they have lower costs on the edges.\n\nWait, candidate_id=2's edge_summary includes \"Sun Valley->Salt Lake City\":44, which is cheaper than going through Ogden.\n\nSo maybe choosing a candidate that goes through Salt Lake City first might avoid the expensive Sun Valley->Ogden edge.\n\nLooking at candidate 6: bundle [\"Salt Lake City\", \"Vernal\", \"Ogden\"]\n\nEdge_summary includes \"Sun Valley->Salt Lake City\":44, which is much cheaper than going to Ogden directly (418). So their path might be more efficient, avoiding the expensive edge.\n\nTherefore, candidate_id=6 seems better because it uses a cheaper initial edge and avoids relying heavily on Sun Valley->Ogden.\n\nBut I need to check if their total lb cost is lower. Candidate 6's transport_lb_cost is 1075, which is higher than some others. However, the edge costs might be more efficient overall.\n\nAlternatively, candidate_id=2 has a transport_lb_cost of 969 and uses Salt Lake City->Vernal, then Vernal->Ogden.\n\nBut I think the key is to avoid the expensive Sun Valley->Ogden edge, so candidates that route through Salt Lake City first are better.\n\nTherefore, between candidates 2 and 6, both use Salt Lake City but have different subsequent cities. Maybe candidate_id=2 goes to Vernal after Salt Lake City, which has a min meal cost of 14, while candidate 6 also goes to Vernal. Not sure if that matters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose the one with the lowest overall lb costs. Looking at lb_costs:\n\nCandidate 0: transport 638\nCandidate 2: transport 969\nCandidate 6: transport 1075\n\nWait, higher numbers might be worse? So candidate 0 has lower transport cost.\n\nBut if candidate 0 uses the expensive Sun Valley->Ogden edge, maybe it's not better despite lower lb costs.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Maybe I should go with the candidate that doesn't rely on the expensive edge, even if their lb_costs are higher. So candidate_id=2 or 6.\n\nBut in the failure_report, the current bundle is \"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\", which includes the expensive edge, so perhaps avoiding Provo and Ogden as much as possible would be better.\n\nWait, but all candidates include Ogden except maybe some? No, looking back:\n\nCandidate_id=2: [\"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\"] - still includes Ogden.\n\nSo regardless, all candidates include Ogden. Hmm.\n\nThen perhaps the next best thing is to choose a candidate with minimal soft penalties or better meal and hotel slacks.\n\nLooking at city_summary for each:\n\nCandidate 0: Salt Lake City has meal slack 19, Provo not specified but in their summary.\n\nWait, looking again, each candidate's city_summary includes all three cities in their bundle. So for candidate_id=2, the cities are \"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\".\n\nLooking at Vernal: meal slack is 31, which is higher than others. Maybe that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, candidate_id=6 has Vernal with meal slack 31 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for cities with lower meal slacks since that indicates less pressure on meals.\n\nBut all candidates have high meal slacks except maybe some.\n\nLooking back:\n\nCandidate_id=0: Salt Lake City meal slack is 19\nProvo (in candidate 0): not sure what's in their city_summary. Wait, no, each candidate only includes cities in their bundle.\n\nSo for candidate_id=0, they have \"Ogden\", \"Provo\", \"Salt Lake City\". Each has their own slacks.\n\nSimilarly, candidate_id=1 is same as 0.\n\nI think I'm stuck because all candidates include Ogden and the expensive edge. Maybe it's best to choose a candidate with minimal impact on that edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at how each candidate's edge usage affects the bottleneck.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Maybe the best approach is to select the candidate with the least reliance on the expensive edge or who can reroute better.\n\nWait, but all candidates include Ogden and thus use Sun Valley->Ogden. So perhaps none are perfect, but some have alternative routes that might be better.\n\nAlternatively, since all except 5 are included, maybe the safest choice is candidate_id=0 because it's the same as current bundle and known to work, even if it has higher costs.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the failure_report, the issue was with edge \"Sun Valley->Ogden\". So perhaps candidates that don't use this edge are better, but all except 5 include it.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best choice is to pick a candidate that uses this edge as little as possible or has alternative routes.\n\nBut since all bundles include Ogden, they have to go through it. Maybe choosing the one with the least number of edges going through Sun Valley->Ogden.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for candidates who can enter the network at Salt Lake City instead of going through Ogden.\n\nCandidate_id=2's bundle is \"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\", so they have to go from Vernal to Salt Lake City. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, their edge_summary includes \"Sun Valley->Salt Lake City\":44, which is cheaper than 418 for going to Ogden. So maybe the route goes Sun Valley -> Salt Lake City (cheap), then to Vernal, then to Ogden.\n\nThat way, only a small portion of traffic uses the expensive edge.\n\nWhereas candidate_id=0's route would have more traffic on the expensive edge since they go directly from Sun Valley->Ogden and maybe also use other edges involving Ogden.\n\nTherefore, perhaps candidate_id=2 is better because it minimizes the usage of the expensive edge by routing through Salt Lake City first.\n\nSo I think the best choice is candidate_id=2.\n</think>\n\nThe best candidate to select is **Candidate 2**, as they minimize reliance on the expensive \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" edge by routing through Salt Lake City first, thus reducing overall costs and potential bottlenecks.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{2}",

      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out which candidate ID to choose for the next MCTS attempt. The task is to select the best candidate based on some criteria and then output a FailureGradient. Let me break down the information provided.\n\nFirst, the hard rules say that the candidate_id must be an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive. So I can only pick from those IDs: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Also, I shouldn't invent any cities; just choose based on the given data.\n\nLooking at the failure_report, the failed_phase is \"unknown\", so maybe there's no specific phase to avoid. The dead_end_city is null, which means I don't need to worry about avoiding any city due to a dead end. However, in the current problem, there are some constraints from the 'bottleneck' information.\n\nThe output_schema requires me to provide candidate_id, reason, confidence, and gradient with hard_exclusions, soft_penalties, and retrieval_patches. I'll focus on selecting the best candidate first.\n\nNow, looking at each candidate's data:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Bundle is [\"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\"]. The bundle_risk shows that the bottleneck_edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\". Edge_summary for this edge has min_cost 418.0 and it's not blocked.\n  \n- **Candidate 1**: Bundle is [\"Ogden\", \"Cedar City\", \"Salt Lake City\"], with bundle_risk showing a bottleneck_edge of \"Cedar City->Salt Lake City\" which isn't blocked.\n\nWait, no, looking again: Each candidate has their own bundle and their own bottleneck edge. For example:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: bottleneck_edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\".\n- **Candidate 1**: It's the same as Candidate 0 but different cities.\n- Wait, actually, each candidate's bundle_risk shows a specific bottleneck_edge.\n\nI need to find which candidate has the least problematic edge or perhaps the one with the lowest cost for their bottleneck edge.\n\nLooking at all candidates:\n\n- **0**: Bottleneck edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" (min_cost 418).\n- **1**: Bottleneck edge is \"Ogden->Cedar City\" (cost 463).\n- **2**: Bottleneck edge is \"Vernal->Salt Lake City\" (cost 277).\n- **3**: Bottleneck edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" (same as 0, cost 418).\n- **4**: Bottleneck edge is \"Cedar City->Ogden\" (cost 463).\n- **5**: Bottleneck edge is \"Sun Valley->Ogden\" again (cost 418), same as 0.\n- **6**: Bottleneck edge is \"Ogden->Sun Valley\" which is the reverse of others, cost 417.\n\nSo the bottleneck edges vary. The idea is to choose a candidate where their critical edge isn't causing issues, perhaps lower cost or less likely to fail.\n\nSince all candidates have non-blocked edges (blocked: false), I need to look elsewhere. Maybe consider the total lb_costs.\n\nLooking at each candidate's lb_costs:\n\n- **0**: 1485.0\nWait, no: Looking back, each candidate has transport_lb_cost, stay_lb_cost, meal_lb_cost, and bundle_lb_cost. For example:\n\nCandidate 0:\ntransport: 1485? Wait, looking at the data provided earlier, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, each candidate's lb_costs are listed as transport, stay, meal, and bundle.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nLooking back, all candidates have similar structures. For example:\n\nCandidate 0: transport_lb_cost=1485? Wait no, looking at the data:\n\nActually, for each candidate, their lb_costs are:\n\n- Candidate 0:\n  transport: 1075\n  stay: 686\n  meal:264\n  bundle:2025\n\nWait, no. Let me look carefully.\n\nNo, in the initial problem statement, each candidate has their own data.\n\nLooking back, for example:\n\nCandidate 0's lb_costs are transport_lb_cost=1075.0, stay_lb_cost=686.0, meal_lb_cost=264.0, bundle_lb_cost=2025.0.\n\nSimilarly, others have varying costs.\n\nI think the key is to find a candidate with a lower total cost or perhaps more balanced costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the confidence is based on how well each city's metrics are.\n\nLooking at each candidate's cities in their bundle:\n\nEach has three cities. The city_summary provides days, nights, hotel_min_price, slack, meal_slack, etc.\n\nPerhaps I should look for candidates where all cities have high slacks and low min_prices. For example:\n\nLooking at Candidate 2: Cities are [\"Salt Lake City\", \"Vernal\", \"Ogden\"].\n\n- Salt Lake City: days=2, nights=2; hotel_min_price=117, meal_slack=16.\n- Vernal: hotel_min_price=81, meal_slack=31.\n- Ogden: hotel_min_price=145, meal_slack=22.\n\nThis seems good because Vernal has a lower min_price and higher meal_slack. But I'm not sure how this directly affects the selection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look at the confidence level. Since all candidates have high feasibility (return_leg_exists is true and hotels are feasible), perhaps another factor is needed.\n\nWait, in the output_schema, \"gradient\" includes hard_exclusions, soft_penalties, etc. Maybe I need to create a gradient that excludes certain phases or applies penalties based on the candidate's data.\n\nBut for selecting the candidate_id, maybe the main criteria is just choosing one based on minimal costs or best bundle metrics.\n\nAlternatively, since all candidates have similar structures and no blocked edges, perhaps any can be chosen, but with confidence based on their lb_costs.\n\nLooking at Candidate 2: Their total lb_cost is transport=1075, stay=686, meal=264, bundle=2025. So maybe it's not the lowest.\n\nWait, actually looking again:\n\nCandidate 3 has transport_lb_cost=969, which is lower than some others.\n\nBut perhaps the confidence can be based on how stable their costs are or if they have less variance.\n\nAlternatively, since all candidates seem similar, perhaps I can choose any with equal confidence. But to be safe, maybe pick the one with the lowest bundle lb cost.\n\nLooking at all bundle_lb_cost:\n\n- 0:2025\n-1:1935\n-2:2040\n-3:1935\n-4:1949\n-5:2025\n-6:2040\n\nSo candidates 1 and 3 have the lowest bundle lb_cost at 1935.\n\nBut maybe I should consider other factors. Alternatively, perhaps choosing a candidate that has a lower meal_lb_cost as this might indicate better meal options.\n\nLooking at meal_lb_costs:\n\n- 0:264\n-1:240\n-2:279\n-3:240\n-4:255\n-5:264\n-6:279\n\nSo candidates 1 and 3 have the lowest meal costs at 240. That might be a good sign.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe any candidate can be chosen, but based on some criteria like minimal total cost.\n\nAlternatively, since all are similar, maybe choose candidate 1 or 3 as they have lower costs in some areas.\n\nWait, let's see the confidence part: It should be a float between 0 and 1. If I'm choosing any candidate without strong preference, perhaps set confidence to 0.8.\n\nAs for the gradient, since all edges are non-blocked, maybe no hard exclusions. Soft penalties could be based on higher costs in certain areas.\n\nBut the task is just to select a candidate_id with reasoning. Since I can choose any between 0-6, and perhaps there's no strong reason to prefer one over others, but considering that candidates 1 and 3 have lower meal costs and bundle costs, maybe pick either of them.\n\nAlternatively, if all are equally good, perhaps randomly choose, but since I need a specific answer, I'll go with candidate 2 as an example.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Constraints:** Candidate IDs must be between 0 and 6. The goal is to select the best based on given data without inventing new cities.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Candidate:** Reviewed each candidate's bundle, bottleneck edge, lb_costs, and city metrics.\n\n3. **Consider Costs:** Noted that candidates 1 and 3 have lower meal_lb_cost (240) compared to others, indicating better meal options.\n\n4. **Decision:** Chose candidate ID 1 based on its lower meal cost and overall bundle lb_cost of 1935, which is the lowest among some candidates.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 1,\n  \"reason\": \"Lower meal_lb_cost and bundle_lb_cost compared to others.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"meal\", \"feature\": \"cost\", \"delta\": -0.2}\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the hard rules: the candidate_id must be an integer between 0 and 6, and I shouldn't invent any cities—only choose from the given IDs. Also, I need to return JSON with specific keys only, without listing any cities.\n\nThe failure_report mentions that the failed_phase is \"unknown\", but more importantly, there are some violations: \"missing_flight\" and \"outbound\". This suggests issues with flight availability or perhaps an outbound journey problem. The current_bundle includes [\"Ogden\", \"Moab\", \"Salt Lake City\"], and the current_bottleneck is around hotel prices in Ogden and meal costs in Salt Lake City, along with some transport costs.\n\nLooking at the output_schema, I need to provide a candidate_id, reason, confidence as a float between 0 and 1, and a gradient that includes hard_exclusions, soft_penalties, and retrieval_patches. The hard_exclusions have specific rules about missing_flights and outbound issues, each with a TTL of 7 days. For soft_penalties, I should consider hotel prices in Ogden and meal costs in Salt Lake City.\n\nNow, looking at the candidates:\n\n- Candidate 0: Bundle is [\"Ogden\", \"Vernal\", \"Salt Lake City\"]. The lb_costs are transport:1075, stay:686, meals:264. The bundle_risk shows a bottleneck in hotel prices and meal costs, but no flights missing.\n- Candidate 1: Similar to 0 but with different cities; I need to check if it's better than others.\nWait, actually, all candidates seem to have similar issues regarding hotel and meal costs, as per the current_bottleneck.\n\nBut considering that candidate 0 has a lower bundle_lb_cost compared to others? Let me check:\n\nCandidate 0: transport is 1075, stay 686, meals 264. Total around 2025.\nOther candidates like 3 and 4 have similar or slightly higher costs.\n\nBut the main issue is the violations for \"missing_flight\" and \"outbound\". So, I need to ensure that the selected candidate doesn't have missing flights or outbound problems.\n\nLooking at each candidate's edge_summary:\n\nCandidate 0: All edges are unblocked. The only problem would be the costs.\nCandidates 1-6 also have all edges unblocked except for specific transport routes, but none mention blocked flights.\n\nWait, actually, all candidates have their edge_summary with no blocked edges. So perhaps the flight issues are not in these bundles but elsewhere? Hmm, maybe I need to choose a candidate that minimizes the current bottleneck issues.\n\nThe confidence should be based on how well each candidate addresses the bottlenecks. Since all have similar costs, maybe I pick one that has lower meal costs or hotel prices.\n\nCandidate 0: Meal cost delta is 264.\nCandidate 1: Not sure, but perhaps higher.\nWait, looking back, it's better to choose based on the given data. Since candidate 0 has a lower bundle_lb_cost overall and no specific flight issues mentioned in its edges, maybe it's the best choice despite the bottlenecks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think candidate 0 is the best option with an 85% confidence because it seems to have slightly better cost management, even though there are still some bottlenecks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 0,\n  \"reason\": \"Minimizes current bottlenecks in hotel and meal costs\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [\n      { \"phase\": \"missing_flight\", \"rule\": \"hard_exclusion\" },\n      { \"phase\": \"outbound\", \"rule\": \"hard_exclusion\" }\n    ],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      { \"phase\": \"hotel_price\", \"feature\": \"Ogden_hotel\", \"delta\": -0.15 },\n      { \"phase\": \"meal_cost\", \"feature\": \"Salt_Lake_Meal\", \"delta\": -0.2 }\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",
