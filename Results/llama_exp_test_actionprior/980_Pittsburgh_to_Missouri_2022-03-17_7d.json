These represent hard exclusions for certain bundles based on phase, rule, TTL (time to live), and potentially city or edge.\n\t* `soft_penalties`: A list of objects with three properties: `phase`, `feature`, and `delta`. These represent soft penalties for bundles based on features like distance, time, or cost.\n\t* `retrieval_patches`: A list of objects with three properties: `phase`, `patch`, and `ttl`. These represent patches applied to the model during retrieval.\n\nSome possible use cases for this output schema include:\n\n1. **Ranking travel bundles**: Use the `candidate_id` and `confidence` values to rank different travel bundles based on their suitability.\n2. **Identifying issues**: Analyze the `hard_exclusions` list to identify why certain bundles were excluded from consideration.\n3. **Fine-tuning the model**: Examine the `soft_penalties` list to understand how the model is being penalized for various features and adjust the weights or thresholds accordingly.\n4. **Applying patches**: Use the `retrieval_patches` list to apply patches to the model during retrieval, adjusting its behavior based on specific scenarios.\n\nTo work with this output schema, you would need to:\n\n1. Import the JSON object into a programming language like Python or JavaScript.\n2. Parse the object and extract relevant information (e.g., `candidate_id`, `confidence`, etc.).\n3. Use the extracted values to inform decision-making processes, such as ranking bundles or identifying areas for improvement.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with specific tasks or provide more guidance on working with this output schema, feel free to ask!",

      "raw": "This is a JSON output from an optimization algorithm. It contains multiple candidate solutions (indicated by the `id` field) and their corresponding costs (represented as `lb_costs`).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the structure:\n\n* Each solution has an `id` field that corresponds to a number (e.g., 1, 2, ..., 15).\n* The `bundle` field contains a list of cities that are part of the bundle.\n* The `bundle_risk` field represents the risk associated with this bundle, including bottleneck meal slack, attribute slack, hotel price, city, and edge information.\n* The `city_summary` field contains detailed statistics for each city in the bundle, such as days and nights stayed, minimum price, slack, and other relevant metrics.\n* The `edge_summary` field contains the minimum cost of travel between cities in the bundle.\n* The `lb_costs` field represents the total cost of this bundle, broken down into transport, stay, meal, and bundle costs.\n* The `feasibility` field indicates whether a return leg exists and if all hotels are feasible.\n\nTo analyze these results further or extract specific information, you would need to write code in your preferred programming language. Here's an example Python script that could help with this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON output from the optimization algorithm\nwith open('output.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Print some general statistics about the candidate solutions\nprint(\"Number of candidate solutions:\", len(data['candidates']))\n\n# Extract and print details for each solution\nfor solution in data['candidates']:\n    id = solution['id']\n    bundle = solution['bundle']\n    lb_costs = solution['lb_costs']\n\n    # Compute the total cost of this bundle\n    total_cost = sum(cost for phase, feature, delta in lb_costs['soft_penalties'] if feature == 'cost')\n\n    print(f\"Solution {id}:\")\n    print(f\"  Bundle: {', '.join(bundle)}\")\n    print(f\"  Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}\")\n    print()\n\n# Extract and print the best solution\nbest_solution = min(data['candidates'], key=lambda x: sum(cost for phase, feature, delta in x['lb_costs']['soft_penalties'] if feature == 'cost'))\nprint(\"Best Solution:\")\nprint(f\"  ID: {best_solution['id']}\")\nprint(f\"  Bundle: {', '.join(best_solution['bundle'])}\")\nprint(f\"  Total Cost: ${sum(cost for phase, feature, delta in best_solution['lb_costs']['soft_penalties'] if feature == 'cost'):.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis script assumes you have a JSON file called `output.json` containing the output from your optimization algorithm. You can modify it to suit your specific needs and extract any information you require.",
