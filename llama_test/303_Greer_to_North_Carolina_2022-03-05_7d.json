It contains a list of candidate solutions (bundles) with their corresponding costs and feasibility information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n1. **output_schema**: This defines the structure of the output data.\n\t* **candidate_id**: An integer ID for each candidate solution.\n\t* **reason**: A short string explaining why this candidate was generated.\n\t* **confidence**: A float value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is in the quality of this candidate.\n\t* **gradient**: This contains three sublists:\n\t\t+ **hard_exclusions**: A list of tuples containing phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge information. These represent hard exclusions that prevent a solution from being considered valid.\n\t\t+ **soft_penalties**: A list of tuples containing phase, feature, and delta values. These represent soft penalties that can be applied to a solution during optimization.\n\t\t+ **retrieval_patches**: A list of tuples containing phase, patch, and TTL information. These represent patches that can be applied to a solution to improve its quality.\n2. **candidates**: This is the main list of candidate solutions.\n\t* Each element in this list represents a bundle of cities (e.g., Asheville, Charlotte, Fayetteville).\n\t* The bundle contains several key-value pairs:\n\t\t+ **bundle_id**: An integer ID for this specific bundle.\n\t\t+ **city_ids**: A list of integers representing the cities in this bundle.\n\t\t+ **costs**: A dictionary containing various cost metrics (e.g., transport, stay, meal).\n\t\t+ **feasibility**: A boolean indicating whether this bundle is feasible (i.e., all required rules and constraints are satisfied).\n\nTo analyze or work with this data, you'll need to:\n\n1. Parse the JSON object into a Python dictionary using libraries like `json`.\n2. Access the relevant fields in each candidate solution (e.g., **bundle_id**, **costs**).\n3. Use the information in **hard_exclusions**, **soft_penalties**, and **retrieval_patches** to understand why certain solutions were excluded or penalized.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with specific questions about this data or how to work with it, feel free to ask!",

Each tuple has five elements: `[phase, rule, ttl, city?, edge?]`.\n\t* `soft_penalties`: A list of tuples containing information about soft penalties, including phase, feature, and delta. Each tuple has three elements: `[phase, feature, delta]`.\n\t* `retrieval_patches`: A list of tuples containing information about retrieval patches, including phase, patch, and TTL. Each tuple has three elements: `[phase, patch, ttl]`.\n\nThe rest of the output is a list of candidates, each represented by a dictionary with the above fields.\n\nSome possible applications of this model include:\n\n1. Suggesting candidate routes or travel itineraries based on user preferences and constraints.\n2. Identifying potential customers or leads for businesses based on demographic and behavioral data.\n3. Generating alternative solutions to complex problems in domains like logistics, finance, or healthcare.\n\nTo work with this output, you would need to:\n\n1. Understand the structure of the `output_schema` and how it relates to each candidate.\n2. Develop a system to process and analyze the candidate data, potentially incorporating additional information or rules based on your specific application.\n3. Integrate the model's outputs into your workflow, whether through manual review, automation, or further processing.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions about working with this output or would like more context!",
