      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to select the best candidate_id from 0 to 4 for the next MCTS attempt. The output should only be JSON with specific keys: candidate_id, reason, confidence, and gradient.\n\nFirst, let me look at the failure_report. The failed_phase is unknown, but there are violations like missing_flight and outbound. That might mean that some flight connections are missing or there's an issue with the outbound journey.\n\nThe current_bundle is [\"Fayetteville\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"], and the bottleneck is in Fort Myers->Fayetteville for hotels. The hotel price is high, 218.0, which could be a problem.\n\nLooking at the gating_summary, it's using hard_gate with a pool size of 5. Excluded_n is 1, so one candidate was excluded because it's same as current. So from the candidates, id=0 might have been excluded or not? Wait, no: in the candidates list, all ids are present from 0 to 4, each with different bundles.\n\nEach candidate has a bundle of three cities and various summaries. The hard_rules say I must choose an integer between 0-4, only output candidate_id, and return JSON with the specified keys.\n\nThe gradient's hard_exclusions should be one of the listed types, like NO_FLIGHT or AVOID_CITY. Soft_penalties are features like budget_risk or cost_ratio.\n\nI need to prioritize avoiding dead_end_city for hotel/stay failures if possible. Also, prefer candidates without blocked edges for segment/flight issues.\n\nLooking at each candidate:\n\n- Candidate 0: bundle [\"Asheville\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Asheville is the bottleneck. Blocked? No. Hotel prices in Charlotte are high, but all hotels are feasible.\n  \n- Candidate 1: [\"Fayetteville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Fayetteville is blocked? No. Meal slack is zero for Fayetteville.\n\n- Candidate 2: [\"Wilmington\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"]. Blocked edges? No. Similar to candidate 1 but different order.\n\n- Candidate 3: [\"Wilmington\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Wilmington, blocked? No. Meal slack in Wilmington is zero.\n\n- Candidate 4: [\"Asheville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Asheville not blocked.\n\nI think the main issues are high hotel prices and meal slacks being too tight (like Fayetteville has meal_slack 0). So, maybe choose a candidate where the bottleneck isn't so bad.\n\nCandidate 0: The edge is Fort Myers->Asheville with min cost 1220. Meal slack in Asheville is 2, which might be better than others. But hotel in Charlotte is expensive.\n\nWait, all candidates have Charlotte as part of their bundle except for maybe some? Wait no, looking back:\n\nCandidate 0: includes Charlotte\n\nCandidate 1: includes Charlotte\n\nCandidate 2: includes Charlotte\n\nCandidate 3: includes Charlotte\n\nCandidate 4: includes Charlotte\n\nSo all include Charlotte, which has a high hotel price. So that's a problem.\n\nBut the failure_report mentions dead_end_city is null, so maybe that's not an issue here.\n\nThe current_bottleneck is on Fort Myers->Fayetteville edge for hotels. Maybe choosing a candidate where this edge isn't used could help? Or perhaps pick one with lower hotel costs elsewhere.\n\nLooking at city_summary:\n\nCandidate 0: Asheville has a lower hotel_min_price (63) than Charlotte's 218.\n\nWait, but each candidate's bundle includes Charlotte, so the high price is unavoidable. Maybe look for other factors.\n\nTransportation costs vary: lb_costs.transport_lb_cost for candidates are 1929, 1604, 1645, 2027, 2073. So lower might be better. The lowest transport cost is candidate 1 (1604). But I'm not sure if that's the main factor.\n\nSoft_penalties could include budget_risk or cost_ratio. Maybe higher cost ratios are worse.\n\nWait, each candidate has a 'bundle_lb_cost' which includes all costs. So lower might be better.\n\nCandidate 1 and 2 have lower transport and total lb_costs compared to others.\n\nBut I'm supposed to prefer candidates without blocked edges for flight failures. All edges are unblocked, so that's fine.\n\nAnother consideration is the city_summary's hotel_min_price. Maybe if a candidate has another city with lower prices, it could be better in case Charlotte's high price causes issues.\n\nWait, all bundles include Charlotte, which has 218 hotel min price, but they also have other cities. For example, candidate 0 includes Asheville (63) and Fayetteville (56). So maybe if part of the bundle is cheaper elsewhere, it might be better for budget risk.\n\nBut since the failure_report's current_bottleneck is Charlotte in terms of hotel_price, I need to see if any candidates have a different structure that could avoid this.\n\nWait, no. All candidates include Charlotte, so they all have the same hotel price issue.\n\nSo maybe the best approach is to choose the candidate with the lowest overall lb_costs. Candidate 1 has the lowest transport_lb_cost and bundle_lb_cost of 3632, which is better than others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look at the feasibility: all are feasible, so no problem there.\n\nSo based on the cost, candidate 1 seems best.\n</think>\n\n{\"candidate_id\": 1, \"reason\": \"Lowest transportation and total costs while avoiding blocked edges.\", \"confidence\": 0.9, \"gradient\": {\"hard_exclusions\": [], \"soft_penalties\": [{\"phase\": \"hotel\", \"feature\": \"budget_risk\", \"delta\": -0.2}, {\"phase\": \"flight\", \"feature\": \"cost_ratio\", \"delta\": -0.1}], \"retrieval_patches\": []}}",

      "raw": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to select the best candidate_id for the next MCTS attempt and output a FailureGradient based on the given data. The task specifies that I should choose only from candidates 0 to 4 and provide the result in JSON format with specific keys: candidate_id, reason, confidence, and gradient.\n\nFirst, I'll review the provided information carefully. The failure_report mentions that the current bundle is [\"Fayetteville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"], and there are violations like \"missing_flight\" and \"outbound\". This suggests that the previous attempt might have issues with flights, possibly making some edges unavailable or causing dead ends.\n\nLooking at the gating_summary, it's in hard_gate mode with a gated_pool_size of 5. One candidate is excluded because it's the same as the current bundle. So, I need to focus on the remaining five candidates but be cautious about any that might repeat the same bundle.\n\nNow, examining each candidate:\n\n- **Candidate 0**: Bundle is [\"Fayetteville\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"]. The edge from Fort Myers->Fayetteville is blocked? Wait, no—it's listed as blocked: false. However, looking at the failure_report, there are missing_flight and outbound issues, which might relate to edges not being available. But since all edges here are unblocked, this could be a good option.\n\n- **Candidate 1**: Bundle [\"Asheville\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Asheville is blocked? No, it's also blocked: false. Similar to Candidate 0, no immediate edge issues.\n\n- **Candidate 2**: Bundle [\"Wilmington\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"]. Edge Fort Myers->Wilmington is unblocked, as are the others. But I notice that Fayetteville and Wilmington both have their edges unblocked, so this could be a viable option.\n\n- **Candidate 3**: Bundle [\"Wilmington\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"]. All edges are unblocked again.\n\n- **Candidate 4**: Bundle [\"Asheville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"]. Same as above; all edges are fine.\n\nWait, but the failure_report mentions dead_end_city and dead_end_reason, which were null. So, no immediate dead ends in the current state. The budget_context is also null, so perhaps financial constraints aren't the main issue here.\n\nThe task's hard_rules specify that I should prefer candidates with no blocked edges for segment/flight failures. Since all candidates have unblocked edges (all edge_summary entries are blocked: false), this factor might not differentiate them significantly.\n\nAnother rule is to avoid dead_end_city for hotel/stay failures if feasible. Since there's no dead_end_city reported, maybe this isn't a concern right now.\n\nLooking at the bundle_risk and city_summary:\n\n- All candidates have similar structures in their bundles, but let me check the meal_slack and attr_slack. The current_bottleneck mentions that the hotel price is 218.0 in Charlotte, which is high. So, minimizing costs might be a priority.\n\nLooking at the lb_costs (lower bound costs):\n\n- Candidate 0: transport_lb_cost=1841, stay_lb_cost=674, meal_lb_cost=840 → total bundle_lb_cost=3355.\n- Candidate 1: transport=1929, stay=674, meal=840 → bundle=3443.\n- Candidate 2: transport=1645, stay=756, meal=1272 → total=3673.\n- Candidate 3: transport=2027, stay=770, meal=1092 → total=3889.\n- Candidate 4: transport=2073, stay=770, meal=1092 → total=3935.\n\nSo, the lower the lb_costs, the better. Therefore, Candidate 0 has the lowest bundle_lb_cost at 3355, followed by Candidate 1 at 3443. Candidates 2-4 have higher costs, which could be a concern if budget is tight.\n\nAdditionally, looking at city_summary:\n\nFor each candidate's cities, the meal_slack and hotel_min_price might affect the overall cost. For example, Charlotte has a high hotel price but also a high attr_slack. If there are issues with hotels in Charlotte, maybe we should avoid it, but since all candidates include Charlotte except perhaps those that don't—no, actually, all of them do.\n\nWait, no: looking again, Candidates 0-4 all have Charlotte as part of their bundle because they're all starting from Fort Myers and going through different cities before returning. So, avoiding Charlotte isn't possible here.\n\nGiven that, the main differentiators are the lb_costs and the specific edges involved. Since Candidate 0 has the lowest transport_lb_cost and meal_lb_cost, it seems like a strong candidate. Also, since there were no dead ends reported, this might be a safer choice to avoid future failures.\n\nMoreover, considering the hard_exclusions in the gradient: I need to define which rule applies here. Since all edges are unblocked, perhaps AVOID_CITY isn't necessary unless Charlotte is causing issues. However, based on the failure_report, there's no dead_end_city, so maybe NO_FLIGHT or something else? Wait, the violations were \"missing_flight\" and \"outbound\", which relate to flight availability.\n\nTherefore, I should set a hard_exclusion for NO_FLIGHT for all candidates to prevent future flight issues. That way, if any candidate includes an edge that's causing flight failures, it gets excluded.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\n- **Candidate_id**: 0\n- **Reason**: It has the lowest lb_costs and all edges are unblocked.\n- **Confidence**: High, as it minimizes costs and avoids potential issues.\n- **Gradient**:\n  - Hard_exclusions: A rule to exclude any candidate that includes a missing flight. Since Candidate 0 doesn't have such an edge (all blocked: false), but I'll include this exclusion just in case.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary steps based on the given data and rules.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 0,\n  \"reason\": \"Lowest bundle_lb_cost with no blocked edges.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [\n      {\"phase\": \"flight\", \"rule\": \"NO_FLIGHT\", \"ttl\": 24, \"edge\": \"Fort Myers->Fayetteville\"}\n    ],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which candidate_id is the best for the next MCTS attempt. The task says I should choose only by id from 0 to 4 and provide a FailureGradient with JSON output.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. MCTS stands for Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is used for decision-making processes. In this context, it's probably selecting the best candidate based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at the hard rules, I need to make sure the candidate_id is an integer between 0 and 4. Also, I shouldn't output any city lists—just the id. The JSON should have keys: candidate_id, reason, confidence, gradient.\n\nPrefer avoiding dead_end_city for hotel or stay failures if possible. So, if a city tends to cause issues with hotels or stays, it's better to avoid that candidate. Also, prefer candidates without blocked edges for segment or flight failures. That makes sense because blocked edges would mean no flights available, which is a problem.\n\nThe decision should be based on bundle_risk, city_summary, edge_summary, and lb_costs.\n\nLooking at the failure_report: failed_phase is unknown, dead_end_city is null, so maybe that's not an issue here. The current_bundle is [\"Fayetteville\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"], which might influence decisions if any of these are problematic.\n\nThe current_bottleneck has details about hotel prices and edges. The bottleneck_hotel_price is 218.0 in Charlotte, and the edge Fort Myers->Fayetteville is the bottleneck. There's a missing_flight and outbound violation. So maybe flight issues could affect the candidate selection.\n\nIn the gating_summary, mode is hard_gate with notes about gated_pool_size=5, excluded_n=1, candidates_n=5. So one candidate was excluded because it's the same as current.\n\nLooking at each candidate:\n\nCandidate 0: bundle [\"Asheville\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"], edge Fort Myers->Asheville is blocked? No, it's min_cost 1220 and not blocked. But in the failure_report, the bottleneck_edge was Fort Myers->Fayetteville for current. So maybe this candidate avoids that issue.\n\nCandidate 1: bundle [\"Fayetteville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"], edge Fort Myers->Fayetteville is not blocked, but meal_slack is 0 in Fayetteville—could be a problem if meals are tight there.\n\nCandidate 2: [\"Wilmington\", \"Fayetteville\", \"Charlotte\"], edge Fort Myers->Wilmington. Blocked? No. But again, Fayetteville's meal_slack is 0, same as candidate 1.\n\nCandidate 3: [\"Wilmington\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"], edge Fort Myers->Wilmington. Blocked? No. Meal_slack in Wilmington is 0, but Asheville has some slack. This might be better because if one city has issues, another doesn't.\n\nCandidate 4: [\"Asheville\", \"Wilmington\", \"Charlotte\"], edge Fort Myers->Asheville. Blocked? No. Both Asheville and Wilmington have meal_slacks (2 and 0), but Asheville has more slack which is good.\n\nSo considering the hard rules, I should prefer candidates without blocked edges, so all are fine since none have blocked edges. Next, avoid dead_end_city if possible, but since dead_end_city is null in failure_report, maybe that's not an issue now.\n\nLooking at the lb_costs: lower costs might be better. Let's compare transport_lb_cost:\n\n0: 1929\n1: 1604\n2: 1645\n3: 2027\n4: 2073\n\nLower is better, so candidates 1 has the lowest at 1604. But need to check other factors.\n\nCity_summary for each candidate:\n\nCandidate 0:\nAsheville: meal_slack 2, attr_slack 18\nFayetteville: meal_slack 0, but hotel_min_price is lower than others.\nCharlotte: same as current.\n\nCandidate 1:\nFayetteville: meal_slack 0, which could be a problem.\nWilmington: meal_slack 0, another issue.\nBut the edge costs are lower (Fort Myers->Fayetteville at 1141 vs 1220 for Asheville).\n\nWait, but if both Fayetteville and Wilmington have meal_slack 0, that might cause issues. Meal slack is how much they can vary from min_meal_cost without penalty.\n\nIn the current_bottleneck, meal_slack was 0 in Fort Myers->Fayetteville. So maybe if a candidate has a city with meal_slack 0, it's more risky because any change could cause failure.\n\nSo perhaps candidates that have cities with higher meal_slack are better. Let's check:\n\nCandidate 0: Asheville has meal_slack 2, which is good.\nCandidate 1: Fayetteville and Wilmington both at 0—bad.\nCandidate 2: same as candidate 1.\nCandidate 3: Wilmington at 0, but Asheville at 2—good.\nCandidate 4: Wilmington at 0, Asheville at 2.\n\nSo candidates 0 and 3 have at least one city with positive meal_slack. So maybe those are better options because they're less likely to cause issues if something changes.\n\nLooking back, candidate 0 has a transport_lb_cost of 1929, which is higher than candidate 1's 1604 but lower risk in terms of meal slack. Candidate 3's transport cost is 2027, higher than both 0 and 1.\n\nSo the trade-off is between lower cost (candidate 1) vs. avoiding cities with meal_slack 0 (candidates 0 and 3).\n\nBut in candidate 1, both Fayetteville and Wilmington have meal_slack 0, which might be a problem if something goes wrong with their meal plans. So maybe it's better to pick a candidate that has at least one city without this constraint.\n\nTherefore, candidates 0 and 3 are safer because they include Asheville or Asheville (I think Asheville is the same as Asheville?) Wait no—looking back: candidate 4 includes Asheville, but it also includes Wilmington with meal_slack 0. So maybe candidate 3 is better because it has Wilmington and Asheville.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nCandidate 3's bundle is [\"Wilmington\", \"Asheville\", \"Charlotte\"], so two cities have meal_slack: Wilmington at 0, Asheville at 2. Maybe it's better than candidate 1, which has both at 0. But the edge costs are higher.\n\nSo perhaps the best balance is between cost and risk. Candidate 0 includes Asheville (meal_slack 2), which seems safer, but transport cost is higher. Alternatively, candidate 3 might be a middle ground.\n\nBut let's think about the confidence. Since I'm an assistant, my reasoning should align with preferring lower costs unless there's significant risk. So maybe candidate 1 has the lowest cost but higher risk in meal planning. Candidate 0 is safer in terms of meal_slack but more expensive.\n\nI think the optimal choice here is to go with candidate 1 because it has the lowest transport_lb_cost, even though both Fayetteville and Wilmington have meal_slack 0. Since dead_end_city isn't an issue right now, maybe it's acceptable to take the lower cost risk.\n\nWait no—wait in failure_report, there was a missing_flight and outbound violation. So if another candidate avoids that edge being the bottleneck, perhaps it's better.\n\nLooking at current_bottleneck: edge Fort Myers->Fayetteville is problematic. So candidates who don't use this edge would be better. Candidate 0 uses Fort Myers->Asheville, which might not have the same issues. Similarly, candidate 1 still uses Fort Myers->Fayetteville since it's in their bundle.\n\nWait no, looking at the edge_summary for each candidate:\n\nCandidate 0: edges include Fort Myers->Asheville (min_cost 1220). So this is a different edge than current's Fort Myers->Fayetteville. That might be better because it avoids the problematic edge.\n\nSimilarly, candidate 3 uses Fort Myers->Wilmington, which isn't the same as the current bottleneck.\n\nWait no—looking at each candidate:\n\nCandidate 0: edges include Fort Myers->Asheville.\n\nCandidate 1: edges include Fort Myers->Fayetteville (same as current).\n\nSo if the current problem is with Fort Myers->Fayetteville, then candidates that avoid this edge would be better. So candidate 0 uses a different edge and thus avoids the bottleneck.\n\nTherefore, candidate 0 might be better because it doesn't rely on the problematic Fort Myers->Fayetteville edge. Also, its meal_slack in Asheville is higher (2), which reduces risk.\n\nSo even though transport cost is higher than candidate 1, avoiding the problematic edge could prevent future issues.\n\nHence, I think candidate 0 is a better choice because it avoids using the bottleneck edge and has a safer meal_slack.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 0,\n  \"reason\": \"Avoids the problematic Fort Myers->Fayetteville edge and includes Asheville with higher meal slack.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [\n      { \"phase\": \"meal\", \"feature\": \"meal_slack\", \"delta\": -0.1 }\n    ],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```",
