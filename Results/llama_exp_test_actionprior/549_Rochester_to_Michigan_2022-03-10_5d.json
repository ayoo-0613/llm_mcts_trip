Each bundle has the following properties:\n\n* `id`: a unique integer identifier for the bundle\n* `bundle_risk`: an object with several sub-properties that describe the risks associated with this bundle:\n\t+ `bottleneck_meal_slack`: how much slack there is in terms of meal costs\n\t+ `bottleneck_attr_slack`: how much slack there is in terms of attribute costs (e.g. hotel prices)\n\t+ `bottleneck_hotel_price`: the minimum hotel price required for this bundle\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_meal`: the city and meal combination with the highest cost\n\t+ `bottleneck_city_hotel`: the city and hotel combination with the highest cost\n\t+ `bottleneck_edge`: the edge (route) with the highest cost\n* `city_summary`: an object that summarizes the costs for each city in the bundle:\n\t+ `days`: the number of days required to visit this city\n\t+ `nights`: the number of nights spent at this city's hotel\n\t+ `hotel_min_price`: the minimum price of the hotel at this city\n\t+ `meal_slack`: how much slack there is in terms of meal costs\n\t+ `min_meal_cost`: the minimum cost of meals at this city\n\t+ `attr_slack`: how much slack there is in terms of attribute costs (e.g. hotel prices)\n* `edge_summary`: an object that summarizes the costs for each route (edge) in the bundle:\n\t+ `min_cost`: the minimum cost of the edge\n\n**Output Schema**\n\nThe `output_schema` key describes the structure and format of the output data:\n\n* `candidate_id`: an integer identifier for each candidate solution\n* `reason`: a short string describing why this candidate is being considered (e.g. \"best known solution\")\n* `confidence`: a floating-point value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident we are in the quality of this candidate solution\n* `gradient`: an object with several sub-properties that describe the soft penalties associated with each phase:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of tuples containing the phase, rule, TTL (time to live), city, and edge information for hard exclusions\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of tuples containing the phase, feature, and delta information for soft penalties\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of tuples containing the phase, patch, and TTL information for retrieval patches\n\nOverall, this output schema suggests that the optimization algorithm is trying to find the best bundle (set of cities and routes) while considering various risks, costs, and constraints.",

Each bundle has several associated metrics:\n\t+ `id`: A unique identifier for the bundle.\n\t+ `bundle_risk`: An object containing various risk metrics for the bundle, such as `bottleneck_meal_slack`, `bottleneck_attr_slack`, and `bottleneck_hotel_price`.\n\t+ `city_summary` and `edge_summary`: These are objects that contain statistics about each city in the bundle and the edges between them (e.g., travel costs).\n\t+ `lb_costs`: An object containing lower bound costs for various aspects of the bundle, such as transportation, accommodation, and meals.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object indicating whether a return leg exists and if all hotels are feasible.\n* `output_schema`: This is an object that defines the structure of the output. It contains information about the schema of each field in the candidate bundles.\n\nTo extract insights from this data, you would need to analyze the metrics associated with each bundle and identify patterns or trends. Some possible questions you could answer include:\n\n* Which bundles have the highest risk scores?\n* What are the most expensive bundles?\n* Which cities tend to be paired together in bundles?\n* Are there any correlations between certain risk metrics and bundle feasibility?\n\nTo perform these analyses, you would need to write code that can parse the JSON data and extract the relevant information. Do you have a specific programming language or tool in mind for this task?",
