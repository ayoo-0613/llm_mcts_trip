  "query": "Would you be able to put together a 5-day travel itinerary for two people, kicking off from Raleigh traveling to Texas? Our desired travel dates are from March 9th to March 13th, 2022, and we're interested in visiting two cities within Texas. Regarding dining, we're eager to explore venues offering Italian, French, Mexican, and Chinese cuisines. For accommodations, we require places that permit smoking, and it's important for us to note that we would rather not self-drive during our trip. Our expenditure cap is set at $4,500 for the duration of this trip.",
