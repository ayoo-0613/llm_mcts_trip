      "raw": "This appears to be a JSON-formatted output of some kind of machine learning model or algorithm. The structure is complex and contains multiple nested objects, but I'll try to break it down for you.\n\n**Main Object**\n\nThe main object has several properties:\n\n* `candidate`: an array of candidate solutions, each represented as an object with various attributes (explained below).\n* `output_schema`: a dictionary that defines the schema of the output data. It contains information about the types and formats of each property in the output data.\n\n**Candidate Object**\n\nEach candidate solution is represented by an object with the following properties:\n\n* `id` (integer): a unique identifier for the candidate.\n* `reason` (short string): a brief explanation of why this candidate was generated.\n* `confidence` (float between 0 and 1): a measure of how confident the model is in this candidate solution.\n* `gradient`: an object that contains information about soft penalties, hard exclusions, and retrieval patches. This property has three sub-properties:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: a list of objects with properties for each exclusion rule (phase, rule, TTL, city?, edge?).\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: a list of objects with properties for each penalty (phase, feature, delta).\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: a list of objects with properties for each patch (phase, patch, TTL).\n\n**Other Properties**\n\nThe main object also contains some other properties that might be relevant:\n\n* `output_schema` (dictionary): as mentioned earlier, this defines the schema of the output data.\n* `input_data` (not shown in the snippet): presumably, this would contain the input data used to generate the candidate solutions.\n\nOverall, this appears to be a complex algorithmic output that's difficult to interpret without more context or information about what the model is trying to solve.
