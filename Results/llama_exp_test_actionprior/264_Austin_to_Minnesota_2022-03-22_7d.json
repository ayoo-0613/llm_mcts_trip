The `reason` field is a short string.\n3. The `confidence` field is a float between 0 and 1.\n4. The `gradient` field has three subfields:\n\t* `hard_exclusions`: a list of dictionaries with keys `phase`, `rule`, `ttl`, `city?`, and `edge?`.\n\t* `soft_penalties`: a list of dictionaries with keys `phase`, `feature`, and `delta`.\n\t* `retrieval_patches`: a list of dictionaries with keys `phase`, `patch`, and `ttl`.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n1. For each candidate, calculate the `hard_exclusions` score by counting the number of excluded phases, rules, and cities/edges.\n2. For each candidate, calculate the `soft_penalties` score by summing up the delta values for each phase-feature pair.\n3. Calculate a confidence score based on the candidate's feasibility (return leg exists) and hotel feasibility.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1. Sort candidates by their `hard_exclusions` score in ascending order (fewer exclusions are better).\n2. For ties, sort by `soft_penalties` score in descending order (lower penalties are better).\n3. For further ties, use the confidence score as a tiebreaker.\n\n**Best Candidate:**\n\nBased on the evaluation criteria and ranking process, the best candidate is:\n\n* **Candidate 4**: {id: 4, bundle: [\"Minneapolis\", \"St. Cloud\", \"Gustavus\"]}\n\nThis candidate has the lowest `hard_exclusions` score (0 exclusions), followed by a low `soft_penalties` score (922.0). Its confidence score is high due to good feasibility and hotel feasibility.\n\n**Output:**\n\nThe output for the best candidate is:\n```\n{\n  \"candidate_id\": 4,\n  \"reason\": \"\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"gradient\": {\n    \"hard_exclusions\": [],\n    \"soft_penalties\": [{\"phase\": \"stay\", \"feature\": \"hotel_feasibility\", \"delta\": -922.0}],\n    \"retrieval_patches\": []\n  }\n}\n```\nNote that this output is a simplified representation of the actual output, which would include more detailed information about the candidate's scores and features.",
