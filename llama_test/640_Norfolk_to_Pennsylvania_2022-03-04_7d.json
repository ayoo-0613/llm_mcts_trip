For example:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nwith open('output.json') as f:\n    output = json.load(f)\n\nfor bundle in output['bundles']:\n    print(f\"Bundle {bundle['id']}:\")\n    print(f\"Cities: {', '.join(bundle['bundle'])}\")\n    print(f\"Costs:\")\n    for key, value in bundle['lb_costs'].items():\n        print(f\"{key}: ${value:.2f}\")\n    print()\n```\n\nThis script will output the bundle ID, cities, and costs for each bundle in the `output.json` file.",
