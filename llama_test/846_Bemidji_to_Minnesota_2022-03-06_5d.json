Each rule is represented as an array with four elements: phase, rule, TTL (time to live), and city/edge information (optional).\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of features with their corresponding penalties. Each penalty is represented as an array with three elements: phase, feature name, and delta (the penalty value).\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of patches that modify the retrieval process. Each patch is represented as an array with three elements: phase, patch type, and TTL.\n\nThe actual data for each bundle is not shown in this output snippet, but it would typically be included under the `candidate_id` field.\n\nTo work with this data, you can use a programming language like Python or R to parse the JSON structure and access the relevant fields.",
