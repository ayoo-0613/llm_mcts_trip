Each object has several fields:\n\t+ `phase`: The type of travel (e.g., flight, train, bus).\n\t+ `rule`: The specific rule that was violated.\n\t+ `ttl`: The time-to-live for this exclusion (possibly related to the duration of the travel).\n\t+ `city?` and `edge?`: These fields are optional and might represent additional constraints or characteristics of the excluded travel leg.\n* **Soft penalties**: A list of objects, each describing a soft penalty (e.g., \"phase\" = \"flight\", \"feature\" = \"layover\"). Each object has two fields:\n\t+ `phase`: The type of travel (e.g., flight, train, bus).\n\t+ `feature`: The specific feature that was penalized.\n\t+ `delta`: A numeric value representing the penalty amount.\n* **Retrieval patches**: A list of objects, each describing a patch or adjustment to be applied during the retrieval process. Each object has three fields:\n\t+ `phase`: The type of travel (e.g., flight, train, bus).\n\t+ `patch`: The specific change to be made (e.g., replacing a flight with a train).\n\t+ `ttl`: The time-to-live for this patch.\n\n**Data**\n\nThe rest of the JSON object contains an array of candidate solutions, each represented by an object with fields corresponding to those defined in the `output_schema`. There are 10 candidate solutions in this example.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a machine-generated output, and its interpretation depends on the specific context and requirements of your application.

      "raw": "This is a JSON file containing a list of bundles, each representing a travel itinerary. Each bundle has various attributes such as `id`, `bundle`, `city_summary`, and `edge_summary`. Here's an analysis of the structure:\n\n1. **Bundles**: The outermost object contains a list of bundles.\n2. **Bundle**: Each bundle is represented by an object with the following attributes:\n\t* `id`: A unique identifier for each bundle.\n\t* `bundle`: An array of cities that make up the itinerary (e.g., [\"Denver\", \"Alamosa\", \"Gunnison\"]).\n3. **City Summary**: Each city in the bundle has a corresponding summary object, which includes:\n\t* `days`: The number of days spent in this city.\n\t* `nights`: The number of nights spent in this city.\n\t* `hotel_min_price`: The minimum price for accommodations in this city.\n\t* `hotel_slack`: A slack variable for hotel prices (likely used for optimization).\n\t* `meal_slack`: A slack variable for meal costs (likely used for optimization).\n\t* `min_meal_cost`: The minimum cost of meals in this city.\n\t* `attr_slack`: A slack variable for attractions (likely used for optimization).\n4. **Edge Summary**: Each pair of cities in the bundle has an edge summary object, which includes:\n\t* `min_cost`: The minimum transportation cost between these two cities.\n\nTo extract specific information from this data structure, you can use JSON parsing techniques and traverse the objects using their attributes.\n\nHere's a sample Python code snippet to get you started:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON file\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n    bundles = json.load(f)\n\n# Extract all cities in the bundles\nall_cities = set()\nfor bundle in bundles:\n    for city in bundle['bundle']:\n        all_cities.add(city)\n\nprint(all_cities)  # Output: {'Denver', 'Alamosa', 'Gunnison'}\n\n# Extract the minimum transportation cost between each pair of cities\ntransportation_costs = {}\nfor bundle in bundles:\n    for i in range(len(bundle['bundle'])):\n        city1 = bundle['bundle'][i]\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(bundle['bundle'])):\n            city2 = bundle['bundle'][j]\n            edge_summary = bundle['edge_summary'].get(f'{city1}-{city2}')\n            if edge_summary:\n                transportation_costs[f'{city1}-{city2}'] = edge_summary['min_cost']\n\nprint(transportation_costs)  # Output: {'Denver-Alamosa': 36, 'Alamosa-Gunnison': 197}\n```\nThis code extracts all cities in the bundles and prints them as a set. It also extracts the minimum transportation cost between each pair of cities and prints it as a dictionary.\n\nNote that this is just a starting point, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements.",
