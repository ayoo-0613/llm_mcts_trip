Each object contains:\n\t\t- `days`: The number of days to stay in this city.\n\t\t- `nights`: The number of nights to stay in this city.\n\t\t- `hotel_min_price`: The minimum price for hotels in this city.\n\t\t- `hotel_slack`: A slack value for hotel prices in this city.\n\t\t- `meal_slack`: A slack value for meal prices in this city.\n\t\t- `min_meal_cost`: The minimum cost of meals in this city.\n\t\t- `attr_slack`: A slack value for attribute costs in this city.\n\t+ `edge_summary`: An array of objects, each representing an edge between cities in the bundle. Each object contains:\n\t\t- `min_cost`: The minimum cost of traveling between these two cities.\n\t\t- `blocked`: Whether this edge is blocked (i.e., cannot be used).\n\t+ `lb_costs`: An object containing lower-bound costs for this candidate:\n\t\t- `transport_lb_cost`: The transport lower bound cost.\n\t\t- `stay_lb_cost`: The stay lower bound cost.\n\t\t- `meal_lb_cost`: The meal lower bound cost.\n\t\t- `bundle_lb_cost`: The bundle lower bound cost.\n\t+ `feasibility`: An object containing feasibility information for this candidate:\n\t\t- `return_leg_exists`: Whether a return leg exists (i.e., the candidate can travel back to the starting city).\n\t\t- `hotel_feasible_all`: Whether hotels are feasible for all cities in the bundle.\n\nThe `output_schema` field contains metadata about the output format, including:\n\n* `candidate_id`: The data type of the candidate ID.\n* `reason`: The data type of the reason string (not specified).\n* `confidence`: The data type of the confidence value (a float between 0 and 1).\n* `gradient`: An object containing three fields:\n\t+ `hard_exclusions`: A list of objects, each representing a hard exclusion (phase, rule, TTL, city?, edge?).\n\t+ `soft_penalties`: A list of objects, each representing a soft penalty (phase, feature, delta).\n\t+ `retrieval_patches`: A list of objects, each representing a retrieval patch (phase, patch, TTL).\n\nThis is a quite complex data structure, and it's not immediately clear what the context or purpose of this output is.

Each candidate has an `id`, which is an integer identifier.\n2. **output_schema**: This defines the structure and types of the output fields in the JSON object. It includes information about the fields:\n\t* **candidate_id**: an integer identifying the candidate.\n\t* **reason**: a short string describing the reason for the candidate's selection.\n\t* **confidence**: a float value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's confidence in the candidate's quality.\n\t* **gradient**: an object containing three lists:\n\t\t+ **hard_exclusions**: a list of objects with fields `phase`, `rule`, `ttl` (time to live), `city?` (indicating whether a city is involved), and `edge?` (indicating whether an edge is involved).\n\t\t+ **soft_penalties**: a list of objects with fields `phase`, `feature`, and `delta`.\n\t\t+ **retrieval_patches**: a list of objects with fields `phase`, `patch`, and `ttl`.\n\nSome observations:\n\n* The candidates have varying numbers of edges, cities, and other features involved.\n* Some candidates have high confidence values (close to 1), indicating that the model is highly confident in their quality.\n* The gradient object suggests that there are multiple phases or stages in the optimization process, with corresponding rules, time limits, and penalties.\n\nTo work with this data, you'll need to write code that can parse and understand the structure of the JSON object. You may also want to investigate the specific machine learning model or algorithm used to generate this output, as well as any relevant domain knowledge about the problem being solved.",
